# Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the Node.js project has a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the TSC is to have a `champion` for each of these
initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their
success.

A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the TSC agenda (even
if the update is `nothing new`) as a way to ensure they are active
and have the support needed.
