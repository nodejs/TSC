# Node.js Funding Sources

The project has enabled GitHub sponsors and an Open Collective
in order to to accept sponsorships.

The funds are to be used for specific efforts as decided by the TSC and
documented on this page.

## Account details

The accounts are manged by the TSC. The user ids and passwords
are shared with TSC members through 1password. All payments for
sponsorships received will be made to the OpenJS Foundation who has
agreed to manage the funds that are received on behalf of the project.

## Disbursements - management

Potential disbursements will be agreed through TSC discussion
and before approval, documented in a PR in the
[TSC repository](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) which adds
the intended use and funding envelope to this page. The disbursement
is considered approved if there's no objections from a project member in 72 hours,
and consensus has been reached in the TSC. Objections can be overridden with a TSC vote.

When work is complete for an approved disbursement, a request will be
made by the TSC to the OpenJS foundation to pay the person chosen by
the TSC to do the work.
