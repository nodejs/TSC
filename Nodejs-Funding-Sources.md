# Node.js Funding Sources

The project has enabled GitHub sponsors and an Open Collective
in order to to accept sponsorships.

The funds are to be used for specific efforts as decided by the TSC and
documented on this page.

## Funding Goals

The main funding goals for the project include:
* Security Lead
* CI stability improvements
* Project health and collaboration

These goals are as documented in the sections which follow and will
be documented in GitHub sponsors and Open Collective pages.

### Security Lead

**Target:** 300,000 USD

**Description:** For the past two years the OSSF has funded a security
lead. This has enabled the project to improve its turn around time for fixing
vulnerabilities, delivering security releases, making the security release
process more efficient through automation and reinvigorate the project's
security team.  This renewed security team has made progress by
defining the threat model for Node.js, tracking progress against the
OpenSSF scorecard, and more.

The urgency and fixed deadlines that are often associated with security issues
are a poor fit for volunteers. Having a security resource whose job is to
work on these issues not only results in faster resolution of security issues,
but it also avoids the burnout of volunteers who might try to squeeze in
urgent issues along with their regular job.

### CI stability improvements

**Target:** 60,000 USD

**Description:** Progress of the project has been impacted by flaky tests over
a number of years, making it the top pain point for the project contributors.
The project needs a dedicated resource who will:
* lead a test reliability strategic initiative, rallying and supporting
  contributors who work to reduce flaky tests. This might include running
  regular test team meetings, documentation, tools, or whatever strategy
  works to achieve more than they can do on their own
* build tools and improve automation that allows
  the project to effectively manage flaky tests to reduce their impact on the CI
* Investigate and fix existing tests being marked as flaky in the status files

### Project health and collaboration

**Target:** 20,000 USD

**Description:** Funds to be used to support general project health
and collaboration.

## Sponsor promotion

It is important that we promote non-monetary sponsors at least as well as
monetary sponsors. We may have limited ability to do that through Open
Collective and GitHub sponsors so we should avoid providing links to those
on the Nodejs.org website or Node.js README.md until we figure out
how to do that.

We also want to make sure that the message is that we generally prefer
people to contribute to the project with people versus a monetary sponsorship
and the ability to make monetary contributions is to cover cases where
that is not possible.

## Account details

The accounts are manged by the TSC. The user ids and passwords
are shared with TSC members through 1password. All payments for
sponsorships received will be made to the OpenJS Foundation who has
agreed to manage the funds that are received on behalf of the project.

## Disbursements - management

Potential disbursements will be agreed through TSC discussion
and before approval, documented in a PR in the
[TSC repository](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) which adds
the intended use and funding envelope to this page. The disbursement
is considered approved if there's no objections from a project member in 72 hours,
and consensus has been reached in the TSC. Objections can be overridden with a TSC vote.

When work is complete for an approved disbursement, a request will be
made by the TSC to the OpenJS foundation to pay the person chosen by
the TSC to do the work.
