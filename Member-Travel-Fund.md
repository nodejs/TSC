## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Node.js
Foundation to travel, spread knowledge about, and support the Node.js 
Foundation projects.

## Restrictions

* Candidates must be Individual Members of the Node.js Foundation.

### Travel Fund Administrators

Members of both the TSC and CommComm are responsible for approving fund requests
and communicating approval/denial through the PR filed by the member requesting. 

Travel fund admins will consider each proposal tagged for their respective group 
in its next regular meeting. Requests tagged for both committees must be reviewed 
and given opportunity to objection through lazy consensus by both groups and 
communicated together by the two chairs. See considerations below to set yourself 
up for success to be approved. 

Linux Foundation Accounts Payable and the Node.js community manager are responsible for 
verifying the requester is an Individual Member of the Node.js Foundation and dispersing funds,
as required to receive funds (see Reimbursement below).

## Process

Any member can apply for travel funds. Each request may take up to a month
for the travel fund administrators to approve or decline.

### Request
* Open a pull request against this repository which adds an entry to the table at the bottom of this file.
 * Include the name of the event you plan to attend.
 * Include the location of the event and where you will be traveling from.
 * Include the presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
 * Include the size of the stipend you wish to receive.
  * Reimbursement stipends are expected to vary with travel distance.
  * In the PR description, tag the group relevant to the request: @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/commcomm-members. 
  If unsure, just pick one, and that group will tag with the other group if they believe it is more appropriate.
* Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.

### Reimbursement
  
Once the request has been approved, provide receipts as attachments in an email stating your name, the participation covered, and the total approved for reimbursement. Send to ap@linuxfoundation.org and cc tracyhinds@linuxfoundation.org with subject `Node.js Member Travel Fund`. Due to privacy, the Individual Members list is not public. This team will verify the requester is on the Individual Members list before funds are dispersed. This dispersement is generally processed within 30 days. The community manager or a member of the Node.js Foundation team within the Linux Foundation will report back amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the Chairs.

**The following considerations are made for approval of the request:**

* Impact: Preference given to underserved communities. More specifically,
within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness about (e.g.
general knowledge about the foundation) there are people, communities and
geographies where that knowledge is not very widespread. This is where
preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be
less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.
* Cost: The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will 
consider the application. Budget for this program is a finite resource.
* Equity: Preference given to individuals who do not have a corporate travel fund and have
not previously received a stipend.

Examples of prior travel requests include attending a TC39 meeting, Collab Summit, and Code + Learn mentoring.
