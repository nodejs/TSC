Subject to the contraints defined in the foundation
charter, these are the areas that the TSC has autonomy
in making decisions (some of which can be delegated to
other groups, for example the CTC).  Outside of these
areas the TSC will collaborate with the board
when making decisions:

* Changes to the contents of any of the repositories
  under github/nodejs.
* Standards and processes covering contributions and interactions
  with repositories and related Internet properties under
  github/nodejs.
* Infrastructure and usage of build tools for components
  built from github/nodejs.  
* Release types/schedules/frequency/delivery vehicles
* Which external components Node will depend on and how they
  will be bundled into Node distributions. (Examples include
  node-gyp, v8, opensll, etc.). This does not include bringing 
  a dependent project itself under the foundation umbrella, but
  does cover including a copy of the code for the dependency
  in the deps tree or including them in the node distributions (ex npm).
* Creating new repositories under github/nodejs and building new
  code/components in these repositories that may or may not
  be shipped as part of Node. This is different than moving
  an existing project/community under the foundation umbrella
  and adding it to github/nodejs. It is also expected that
  from time to time the suitability of a repository under
  github/nodejs may be re-evaluated.
* Overall technical direction for Node.js. This includes
  the top level technical direction as well as decisions
  on which specific features will be included/excluded
  and where to encourage contributions within the community
  as well as all aspects of how the technical direction is managed.
