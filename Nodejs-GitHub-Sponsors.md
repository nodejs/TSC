# Node.js GitHub sponsors

The project has enabled GitHub sponsors in order to to accept
sponsorships. Currently there is only a single one time tier which is
called "sponsor" and one monthly tier which is called "monthly-sponsor"
with no specific rewards.

The funds are to be used for specific efforts as decided by the TSC and
documented on this page.

## Account details

The [account](tbd) is manged by the TSC. The user id and password
are shared with TSC members through 1password. All payments for
sponsorships received will be made to the OpenJS Foundation who has
agreed to manage the funds that are received on behalf of the project.

## Disbursements - management

Potential disbursements will be agreed through TSC discussion
and before approval, documented in a PR in the
[TSC repository](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) which adds
the intended use and funding envelope to this page. The disbursement
is considered approved once TSC consensus in the PR has
been reached.

When work is complete for an approved disbursement, a request will be
made by the TSC to the OpenJS foundation to pay the person chosen by
the TSC to do the work.
