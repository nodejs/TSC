* Chris: upgraded V8 and documented the process; also did some work on the REPL so that classes (and let/const) work
* Domenic: PR reviews for v2.0.0, starting on V8 extension work to improve startup time
* Fedor: worked on fixing some TLS memory issues, so far appears to be a large improvement in memory usage.

* Mikeal: connection too bad to stand up.
* Shigeki: working on SSL issues; root cert updates. Chrome and Firefox do whitelist of CNNIC cert hashes.
* Trevor: looking at bugs, streams compliance

## Minutes

### Release Proposal: v2.0.0 [#1532](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1532)

* Domenic:
  * v8 changes merged
  * worried that we’re getting into a bad cycle of “wait a few more days” for things to land
  * process.send
  * open an rc, add to website for a few days, ship by friday
* Bert/Ben:
  * talk of process.send
    * Ben: should not hold up release, windows tests break right now
    * less of a regression than a change
* Domenic:
  * these releases are a train
  * don’t hold up the train for features
    * make sure it’s ready for 3
* url updates from petka: might be ready
  * ci run passes on all platforms but arm7
* Domenic recalls in the runup to 1.0 – “nobody tests rc's” was the consensus

Chris, Trevor: discussion about how the `master` and `next` branches are used.

* process.send changes will slip for v2.0
* waiting for Petka’s comment and review on url changes (<https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1561>)
* release 2.x asap (friday)

After the release:

* the master branch will contain version 2.x.
* api-breaking changes will land on the ‘next’ branch alongside v8 upgrades. master will be merged into next regularly
* fixes are backported to the maintenance (v1.x) branch

### Forward-port from v1.x [#1559](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1559)

Discussed current plan for backporting patches to maintenance patches.

* Consensus that we should give the “land in master and backport” plan a go and see how it works out.

### Convergence plan (<https://github.com/jasnell/dev-policy/pull/66>)

### Combined node.js/io.js TC/core call [#1413](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1413)

## Next meeting

* April 6th
