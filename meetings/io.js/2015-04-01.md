## Minutes

### Present

* Ben (TC)
* Bert (TC)
* Chris (TC)
* Domenic
* Fedor (TC)
* Jeremiah
* Mikeal
* Trevor (TC)
* Rod

### Mini stand-up

* Ben: rewriting the timers module
* Bert: making it possible to rename node.exe/iojs.exe (made it into 1.6.3); governance documents for Node Foundation
* Chris: building a UTF-8 consumer that can validate/skip invalid glyphs; working on a tool around control flow analysis
* Domenic: not much io.js related
* Fedor: rewrote io.js in Go, deciding whether it should be go.io or io.go
* Jeremiah: managing issues, reviewing PRs, investigating timers bugs
* Mikeal: io.js charter / Linux foundation work
* Trevor: looking into beforeExit/timer unref/uv_loop_alive interactions; Node API compliance working group docs (not io.js ... might be fed into the Foundation)
* Rod: released 1.6.3; GitHub DDOS and CI errors/timeouts are frustrating

### Review of last meeting

* [#1134](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1134) Add Docker working group
* [#1140](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1140) Revert stream base / @piscisaureus / merge policy questions
* [#1130](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1130) Nominating Jeremiah Senkpiel @Fishrock123 to the TC
* [#1077](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1077) Pass args to process.nextTick() / @trevnorris
* Major version bump

### Reconciliation update (Mikeal and Bert)

* Mikeal: getting close to a really good position where the governance structures can be merged between io.js and joyent/node. New working group structure and relationship with “TSC”. People can engage @ <https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/> with active PRs @ <https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/pull/30> & <https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/pull/33>
* Bert: discussed why this is good for io.js:
  - io.js still has a very low profile, merging would be good for everyone
  - budget from corporate backers, including the ability to travel
* Mikeal: added to those comments: institutional backing would be very helpful at this stage
* Ben: current PR seems to give the board more influence than originally suggested
* Mikeal: the intent is the board is not to make technical decisions, the TSC is
* Trevor: counterpoint example is IBM maintaining their own fork of V8 so they may want influence on the release process
* Mikeal: they will be taken care of by an LTS schedule
* Bert: IBM agrees that there should be a fast-moving tip and they just use an LTS. Board could also assert influence by way of a corporation threatening to withdraw backing.

### doc: add NAN WG [#1226](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1226)

* Rod: discussed proposed move of rvagg/nan and rvagg/node-addon-examples to iojs to be governed by an “Addons API Working Group”

Bert: +1
Chris: +1
Fedor: +1
Ben: +1
Trevor: +1

### Proposal: Authorise @Fishrock123 to create releases [#1225](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1225)

* No disagreement, lots of +1s, good to go

### governance: Raise the bar for changes in membership and governance policy [#1222](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1222)

* Mikeal: the PR is a bit stale because of a miscount, just want to make sure that there are no concerns with this even though it may not end up being required given the movements with the TC.
* Rod: requested that we not hold up progress in io.js pending movement on the JNAB / Foundation process and we should treat that as a separate thing that may or may not happen.
* Bert: happy with the changes but can’t +1 because of the TC company proportion counting
* Mikeal: just a miscount, needs to be changed, wanted to test if people are OK with this once we have more people on the TC. Main point was to flush out any concerns about raising the bar.
* Ben: suggested that it become 2 PRs, make the 2/3rds thing a separate issue.

### Nominating Rod Vagg @rvagg to the TC [#1134](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1131)

* Rod: fine with this
* Discussed meeting facilitation, agreed that it wasn’t a strictly defined role but it would be good to share it around a bit.

Bert: +1
Chris: +1
Fedor: +1
Trevor: +1
Ben: +1
