  * no update this week

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* Talk about how Node.js is funded - fund maintainers [#6626](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6626)
  * We have turned on OpenCollective and GitHub sponsors and documented where how we would spend funds - <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/Nodejs-Funding-Sources.md>
  * agreed to remove tsc-agenda for now

* Talk about how Node.js is funded - foundation and company support [#6625](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6625)
  * Discussion on sponsors page on Nodejs.org - <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/discussions/7477>
  * agreed to remove tsc-agenda for now

* Test runner matching every .ts and .js if glob is not provided - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/56546>
  * side effect of enabling TSC support by default, broke some users, will have same problem
    with 22 backport.
  * already a fair number of differences in test runner between the LTS versions, current.
  * A few suggestions in terms of how to address
  * If we want to backport, we need to agree on a solution
  * FYI as there is no solution that does not cause some group some pain.
  * Michael tradeoff is between users of 22 having to opt in, versus breaking people when it
    automatically includes TS files
  * Joyee seems that that auto match behaviour does not seem desirable anyway so does not
    seem like we should backport
  * Marco, would be an option, but some people mentioned they do include both.
  * Joyee still comes down to using with glob, can we backport so that not included by default
  * Marco, likely to be backported in April so no rush but please review and comment
  * Michael Z, I assume when you say it searches everything I assume you mean it does not
    include node_modules. Looking at the code that may not be true and it would run tests in the
    node_modules directory.
  * Richard, a bit worried if we discuss backporting globs to Node.js 20, seems like we have
    already pulled back more than normal due to require esm which is good, but other things are
    being proposed just because we are doing a SemVer minor. Want to be careful about what
    we pull into 20.

### nodejs/TSC

* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
  * talked about shutdown problem before, nothing other specific to discuss

* Open Corepack Vote [#1527](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1527)
  * Marco, added the agenda tag to this one.
    * Something broke in corepack and we had to do a release in all LTS versions. We
      are still working on 20. Work around was for people to do corepack install
      which turned out not to be a huge issue.
    * Based on how people could easily install corepack to address issue, its probably
      a good time to consider if we can remove it as it has been demonstrated people
      can work around, and that there is a burden in including it.
  * Michael Zasso (in chat): <https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/main/docs/version-management/proposal-next-steps.md> AFAIK the vote was postponed until package maintenance team determines it's good to go. But it seems that the initiative lost its momentum
  * Michael anybody in the meeting who object or need more time to consider before
    agreeing it can move forward.
    * Nobody in the meeting raised their hand
    * Marco’s plan is to
      * At mention the package maintenance team in the issue
      * Land the PR if there are no objections on Monday

### nodejs/security-wg

* Update on CVEs for EOL Release Lines – MITRE Removal & Next Steps [#1443](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1443)

System
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57114>
  * issues on windows, smart os and arm
  * Richard found out why the V8 CI was broken and opened a PR to fix it
