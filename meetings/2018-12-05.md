## Agenda

### Announcements

* NodeConf.eu will be held 10th - 13th November 2019

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* HTTP/1 request destroy behavior change on framing error [#24586](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/24586)
  * Express broken because of recent behavior change in the case of a parse error
  * Broke the dependency on-finished module that is not in CITGM, and it is neither covered in the express test suite (https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/issues/631)
  * Need better support and coverage for these, back to the issue tracker
* Fixing child_process module to check values passed strictly to the options object [#24267](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/24267)
  * The options object can be polluted via the Object prototype which can lead to security vulnerability
  * Disagreement on whether we should land this for this specific API instead of doing it for every options in all the APIs
  * Looking for more input
