## Agenda

### Announcements
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* process: improve nextTick performance [#25461](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25461)
  * Anatoli is objecting on that one.
  * Breaks the assumptions based on async resource resources
  * Trott: seems like we are at an impasse. Likely we are heading to a vote.
  * Matteo: not necessarily certain how this plays with the plans for async hooks
  * Anatoli:  if you want to wrap next tick callback, with change, wrapper will never get
    called. In past resource object has been the same as the thing
  * Matteo, understood agreed. Can you post snippet that shows problem
  * Michael, should we suggest vote now?
  * Trott: not yet as long as there is conversation.
  
* buffer: add Buffer.harden() method [28439](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28439)
  * opt in method that helps to harden buffer
  * Jeremiah: should we more generally allow command line options to be set in app only
  * Chalker: prefers proposed API
  * Jeremiah: worth considering for other cases as there are probably other options they liked
    to enable through code even more than this buffer one.
  * Chalker: other modules could they have their own options
  * Chalker: does not automatically apply to child processes, it would be more complex and
    Could introduce breakage.
  * Michael Zasso: I like this idea, advantage of a command-line flag is that it propagates
    to workers.
  * Chalker: will look at interaction with workers.
  * Jeremiah: --frozen-intrinsics might be similar.
  * take discussion back to GitHub.
