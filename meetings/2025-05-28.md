### Reminders

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No update this week

### nodejs/node

* doc: clarify the scope of `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` [#58328](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58328)
  * skipped until next week as we did not haveChengzhong

* Update nghttp2 mc to v1.65.0 [#58293](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58293)
  * Joyee, when sending a request we try http2 before downgrading, diff is not related to that.
  * Matteo, a behavior has been removed from the spec, ngttp2 has implemented that
  * Michael, how many people will be affected?
  * Matteo, its being removed from the standard, API is still then but will be no-ops,
  * Richard, proposal is to backport to 24, would it need to go into LTS lines as otherwise
    we may not be able to update nghttp2 in earlier LTS lines
  * Matteo, we likely will need to upgrade older LTS lines and accept this as well
  * Discussion that we have allowed similar changes due to spec changes in the past
  * No concerns from the TSC members in the meeting

* Revert <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/56664> [#58282](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/58282)
  * Discussion on the change
  * Technically the revert will be SemVer major, so we need TSC approval for it to land in 24.x
  * Only makes sense if we are going to backport to 24.x
  * Joyee, if we are going to revert we should do sooner than later
  * Rafael, we should land and backport before 24.x gets a larger number of downloads
  * From the TSC members in the meeting there were no objections to reverting
  * Joyee do all of the commits needs to be reverted?
    * Flip possibly only 2 of the 3 need to reverted.

* doc: doc that proj has access to linked in [#57401](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57401)
  * Michael, might as well close as Foundation staff have said no.
  * Joyee, is the same ownership for the other projects in the Foundation ?
  * Michael, good questions, not sure.
  * Darshan, seems like the email discussion has stalled out. Not sure how to make progress
  * Joyee, also agree that I donâ€™t remember we ever agreed to this
  * Matteo, lets talk about it privately.

* Deadlock at process shutdown [#54918](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/54918)
  * Joyee, we can remove from the agenda as the fixes have address the pain from the CI,
    and we have not seen issues in the CI for the last few weeks.

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* feat: supporter page and updated home page [#7552](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7552)
  * going to take off the agenda until there is more to discuss.

### nodejs/TSC

* Nominating @panva to the TSC [#1740](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1740)
  * Welcome!

* May is the month for TSC Elections. [#1737](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1737)
  * Only one nomination for each position, will leave open until this Friday and unless there
    Are objections will consider Michae/Matteo re-elected.

* Adopt Datadog Test Optimization tool [#1721](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1721)
  * invite Bryan to a future TSC meeting to discuss?
  * Joyee, if somebody is willing to do the work, then why not?
  * Richard, we did turn on something for Windows (buildpulse). We need a volunteer who
    is going to implement/maintain. Not sure the one added for windows helped
    * Possibly misunderstanding of issue, we know there are flaky tests just nobody looking at
      them
  * If there is a volunteer then make it happen then no objections to implementing it?
  * Joyee, will there be human resources

* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
  * Main CI is better
  * Some discussion about the daily masters, IBM i mentioned specifically
