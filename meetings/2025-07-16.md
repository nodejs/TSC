### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No updates this week

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* Dedicated Partners/Sponsors Page + Updates on the Home Page [#7909](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/7909)
  * Claudio outlined the proposal to highlight our partners/supporters
  * Would co-ordinate with the Foundation marketing team
  * Robin, as part of the sovereign tech fund, we formalized agreements with
    supporting companies. Whenever we bring on a new partner we have a process that is
    documented in the CPC repo and we also sign legal contracts with these partners so that
    we can ensure that the free services they generously provide are there in the future
    despite any turnover these companies may have internally and we also provide guaranteed
    co-marketing with them, in the form of case-study, couple of blogs, discounts in our events,
    training, social media and a guarantee of a prominent brand positioning in our website for
    example.
  * Michael - please cross check against <https://github.com/nodejs/build>
  * Michael, any concerns from the TSC members who are here.

* Dedicated EOL page [#7906](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/7906)
  * Claudio - good to have a dedicated static page, and then links to ESP partners
  * Michael - I think we agreed to work towards to this as a step after changing the link on the
    main page to Matteo’s blog post. Vue has a similar page.
  * Claudio - at this point just asking to see if there are any concerns
  * Matteo - something that might be interesting to include are the vulnerabilities which are not
    patch in the EOL versions.
  * Filip - like idea, however, not certain about displaying all of the details, but maybe just list the
    CVEs and severity. Could possibly have a link.
  * Claudio would need to have list
  * Filip - it can use same dataset that [is-my-node-vulnerable](https://github.com/nodejs/is-my-node-vulnerable) uses
  * James, make it clear they are already known vulnerabilities
  * No objections/concerns from those in the meeting

* Move the homepage security link to the banner [#7899](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/7899)
  * Matteo, this was part of the discussions around the ESP link
  * Previous discussions have superseded this so remove from the agenda

### nodejs/TSC

* Interim TSC Election [#1763](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1763)
  * On agenda as an FYI
  * Have a number of nominations, past the proposed day for nominations
  * One question is whether we should have two vice-chairs or vote for one
  * Matteo will send out email to make sure we have consensus

* Update charter with communication responsibilities [#1754](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1754)
  * Lets skip since we don’t have Darshan
  * There are two different PRs for slightly different proposals. May need to schedule
    a discussion specifically for it.

* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/59004>
  * Was discussed last week,
  * Gireesh, looked for champion in TSC, but no champion
    * As agreed Darshan opened an issue to look interest in the wider community.

### nodejs/admin

* Create a directory for funding individual contributors [#981](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/pull/981)
  * Lets skip since we don’t have Darshan
