  * Governance
    * Coveraged in bootstrap discussion
    * Discussion around making budgets controlled by project as opposed to Foundation board.
    * meta discussion around governance 
  
* New Stream APIs
  * Presented more at collab summit, people seemed happy with work so far
  * Work as it is now does not make sense under org.

* Async hooks
  * Deep dive yesterday, decided to resurrect Matteo’s PR as blocker has been resolved. 
    This PR exposes the current async resource so that it can be used as weakmap key to avoid
    the need for a destroy hook. Helps to address memory leak that we currently have for
    Domains.

* Open Web standards
  * Last week discussions around process to use for proposing/implementing standard
    * Pull request in TSC repo, similar process that we make for collaborator guide
    * Discussion on membership on open standards team
    * Agreed that its probably ok to make members of the team, members of the Node.js org
      as we do for other teams.
