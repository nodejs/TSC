### nodejs/undici

* expose websocket in node bundle [#2217](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2217)
  * Darshan, another client/server implementation of WebSocket <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49478>
  * Joyee we already have a server implementation of WebSocket implemented in C++ for the inspector
  * Yagiz is working on another C++ parser.
  * Geoffrey We have the possibility to ship a WebSocket implementation as a global in v21 and ask for objections. The TSC agrees.
  * Matteo we ship the one in undici and we potentially investigate a C++ replacement for the underlining parser later on, similar to what we did for URL parsing.

### nodejs/uvwasi

* Next release [#228](https://github.com/nodejs/uvwasi/issues/228)
  * Matteo: why does the TSC needs to approve it?
