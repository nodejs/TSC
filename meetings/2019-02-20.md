### nodejs/TSC

  * Board meeting on Friday Feb 22nd.  
  * Items here: https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/projects/1
    * licences for non-code 
    * Travel fund for collab summit. Has been matched to last year but we may have
      more people since the scope is larger (includes JS project members as well)

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * Modules - meeting just before this one, contentious discussions. Trying to meet
    deadline of getting upstreamed before 12.x, but a few contentious issues.
  * N-API - continued to work on adoption, some good progress on modules called out
    earlier as problems for 12.x.  Otherwise regular issues/PR handling. 
  * OpenSSL evolution - security release next week for OpenSSL (1.1.1 and 1.0.2) only
    affects 6.x and 8.x, we should plan for security releases.
  * Workers - no flag but still experimental. Hoping to get out of experimental for 12.x
  * Governance - see announcement on bootstrap
  * New Stream APIs - in limbo, stalled waiting on people
  * Async Hooks - nothing new on that front
  * Open Web Standards - WICG - import maps proposal (bare imports in browser). Major
    change to npm install modules in browser.  WICG work around new file system API also
    thinking about spinning up group around QUIC.  TC39 meeting a few weeks ago, dynamic
    modules not successful, top level await proposal still being worked.  Decorators may be
    another one that people might want to look at.  Work with IETF to standardized .mjs.
