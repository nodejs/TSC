## Agenda

### Announcements

* No announcements this week
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* how to do feature detection [#22585](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/22585)
  * seems that we need to not include in 10.x release going out today
  * Rich, can we set deadline for feature detection as seems there are some strong
    viewpoints on both ends.
  * Gabriel, there is already a package, feature detection may not be as important here.
  * Take larger discussion back to the github tracker, quite likely will come down to vote.

* process: add resolveSwallowed event [#22218](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22218)
   * James, other issue is close, discussion is continuing on 22218.  
   * Anatoli, only closed because did not want to continue to rebase
   * Remove from TSC agenda and let it run its course.

* \[WiP\] buffer: runtime-deprecate buffer constructor in sync mode [#22584](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22584)
  * Nikita, current work in progress, need some tests from CITGM.
  * Would appreciate any help in testing modules
  * 11.x server major cutoff is Oct 1st, but there is some wiggle room
  * Targos going to help out.

* buffer: runtime-deprecate Buffer constructor everywhere by default [#21351](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21351)
  * Nikita, very unlikely to land in next release but hopefully we can land in 12.x
  * Agreed to remove from tsc-agenda.

### nodejs/TSC

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * No Myles so skip this one.

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * V8 currency:
    * V8 7.0 almost ready. Just two commits need to be backported upstream
       [node-v8#78](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v8/issues/78).
      * May open issue to ask to get it landed before stable, as it will be the version for
        11.x.  Should be ready in a few days.
    * Some progress was made towards fixing canary (thanks @refack!). 
      Need more eyes on the PR: [#22920](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22920)
    * N-API - focus on AsyncWorker, Evangelism, examples and test suite. See
    https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/338
  * Workers
    * Inspector support for workers was added, merged yesterday
    * Rich has opened issue on exit criteria for experimental status 
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/22940, please chime in
  * Core Promise APIs, have had PRs to improved coverage, 
    steady state gaining experience before progressing much further
  * Jeremiah, getting ready to be able to demo further at collaborator summit
  * Async Hooks, nothing major to report on this front, need to discuss promise
    hooks APIs opportunities.
