### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

* No updates on board front
* No updates on CPC front this week. Rich is now our official representative.

\*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* errors: display Node.js version at the end of stacktraces [#38332](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/38332)
  * Gireesh, contention is whether it should be under a flag or not
    * if under flag then no issue, but then not necessary of value
    * Robert Nagy, how breaking ?
    * Gireesh, can affect things that depend on stack frame shape, particularly tests.
  * Michael Zasso - all stack traces?
  * Ruben - only for fatal exceptions that will shut down Node.js
  * Gireesh - several instances in help repo where having the version in the stack
    trace would have helped.
  * Michael Z, already did changes in stack traces in v15, did not get a lot of
    reports, might be ok to try.
  * Rich wil kick off a CITGM run and we will look at the results
  * Leave on the agenda to discuss next week.

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * no updates this week

* Migration of core modules to primordials [#30697](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30697)
