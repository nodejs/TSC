### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* tools: add ncrypto updater script [#61613](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/61613)
  * Antoine: James and Yagiz not joining today
  * Joyee: Better go back to GitHub
  * Richard: we need to figure out if we do want to keep nodejs/ncrypto the source of truth
  * Joyee: the biggest issue currently is nodejs/ncrypto doesn't test all configurations we support, like various dynamically linked OpenSSL versions
  * Richard: it could add GHA to test it, but the question about whether we want to move the source of truth remains, the rest is more logistics
  * Antoine: we also have BoringSSL
  * Richard: BoringSSL is tolerated in Node.js but not officially supported
* sqlite: mark as release candidate [#61262](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/61262)
  * Bart gave some context on the current blocker (the current `SyncDatabase` might be renamed to `Database` if there's consensus). Hopefully can be resolved on GitHub.
* Time sensitive: GitHub Actions Cache rate limits (from GitHub staff) [#61436](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/61436)
  * Antoine: How much cache does Jenkins use?
  * Richard: 5GB per platform
  * Joyee: it seems we are sharing caches between main and release branches. Maybe just disable caching the non-main branches
  * Bart: it's possible to use S3 bucket storage for the cache
  * Richard: the org doesn't have S3 storage either
  * Joyee: I can PR in a few lines per workflow to disable sccache on non-main
* build, doc: use new api doc tooling [#57343](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57343)
  * James and Claudio not here, skipping
* util: add colorize functionality [#43523](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43523)
  * Ruben: Should we adopt a chalk-like API in addition to styleText?
  * Joyee: Looks like it can't resolve by itself on GitHub, maybe go for a vote if you want to get a decision?
  * Marco:  I had some issues with `styleText`. I think we should move forward with `colorize`.


### nodejs/TSC

* Dormant Docker Working Group [#1818](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1818)
  * Richard: disconnect between the discussion happening in public and private emails
  * Joyee: would it help if we get people into a meeting to speed up the discussions?
* Collaborator Summits 2026 [#1800](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1800)
  * Dates have been confirmed. 14-15 April.
  * Reminder to propose sessions.
* Update charter with communication responsibilities [#1754](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1754)
  * Joyee: seems stalled for half of an year. Neither Matteo nor James are here, can't make any progress
  * Joyee: the website issue was blocked by this one, recently they restarted discussions about removing reference to mastodon since this issue is not coming to a conclusion
* Self-serve model for funding Node.js work [#1747](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1747)
  * Richard: Webpack seems to have other funding sources even though they are in OpenJSF
  * Joyee: they have open collective it seems
  * Joyee: also noticed that Github security just started donating to Node.js org via github sponsor donating a bigger sum, but that seems to have been agreed by OpenJS before and it's just funneling money this way (because they are GitHub)
* Draft Statement of Work - Test reliability lead [#1629](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1629)
  * Joyee: Looks like there's an overall issue of having some funding, but not enough for 1 FTE, and also no volunteer to do the PM work to hash out the scope of work. Need more volunteer to do that PM work.

### nodejs/web-team

* Nominating @MattIPv4 as `web-admin` [#88](https://github.com/nodejs/web-team/issues/88)
  * Joyee: what is `web-admin`? Why does the decision need to be made by TSC?
  * Richard: it's not very clear. maybe web should have a WG at this point
  * Joyee: going to ask a clarifying question in the issue
