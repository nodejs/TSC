## Agenda

### Announcements
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.
  * Matteo - getting new version of readable streams out later this week

### nodejs/build

* Request for elevated permissions [#1337](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1337)
  * Being worked by build team.  Focus is on breaking down into smaller chunks that can be 
    more easily handed out.

### nodejs/node

* Collaborator nomination - gdams [#21934](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/21934)
  * Discussed last meeting. Michael will look to ongoard George soon.

* fs: implement recursive (mkdirp) functionality [#21875](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21875)
  * Michael - came for tooling user feedback session, broad belief in that group that this
    should just be there. Led to this PR.  
  * Myles - based on number of downloads for modules providing similar functionality
    Agree just needs to be there. PR is pretty much ready to go.

* Password Hashing API [#21766](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/21766)
  * Chalker suggested that we defer until next week to discuss.

* tty: make _read throw ERR_TTY_WRITABLE_NOT_READABLE [#21654](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21654)
  * Could tag stream as readable or writable but was not previously enforced. In a 
     recent version it started enforcing it.
  * In Node 10, there was a regression, error is not readable, PR was to fix
    the error case by throwing a good error.
  * Opened issue in libuv to see if we can get libuv team to fix in libuv.
  * Jeremiah - while linux ttys are duplexable, windows ones are not, maybe
    libuv was aimed at making it more consistent across platforms.  Matteo
    unrelated.  
  * Jeremiah, even if we do should be semver major?  
  * Matteo even if its SemVer major would want to see if we can get it back
    into 10.x
  * Myles, was change in libuv SemVer main ? 
  * Matteo, it was a an unrelated change and the problem was an unrelated consequence
  * Arguably a SemVer major break in the middle of 10.x, so we should consider
    fixing in 10.x
  * Jermiah, ideally accept change in later Major, but preserve functionality for LTS. No easy
    solution.
  * Myles, kick back to issue tracker and setup call to discuss.

* buffer: runtime-deprecate Buffer constructor everywhere by default [#21351](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21351)
  * Chalker requested that we all comment on his proposal in the issue
  * All, comment and then we’ll discuss in next weeks meeting.

### nodejs/TSC

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * Call to figure out when next board meeting is, doodle being worked
  * If there are items to be added to the agenda, add to the project tracker or email
    to Myles.
  * Matteo to add to tracker, extending the travel fund.
  * Myles Added it

* Proposal: add all new core modules under a scope? (too late for http2) [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/389)
  * Matteo, recommend to add PR request to add scopes.  After that recommendation
    that all new modules land in the scope.
