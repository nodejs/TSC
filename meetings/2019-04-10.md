### nodejs/node

* domain: error handler runs outside of its domain [#26211](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26211)
   * Matteo: on agenda because semver major on domains which changes behaviour
     to make them more ergonomic, but we have deprecate domains.
   * If there are no objections will go ahead and land.
   * Will require TSC approval to get into 12.x
   * Gireesh, if error handler is in parent is recovery possible? Matteo, not sure best
     if Gireesh comments in the issue.

* src: do not reuse HTTParser [#25094](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25094)
  * Looks like we can remove this from the agenda, as was added to get more TSC reviews and
    additional reviews have been received.

### nodejs/TSC

* TSC Elections Chair and CPC representative [689](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/689)
  * Matteo no reason to open call for representatives today? No objections let do it.

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * No Myles so no update this week.

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * N-API, working on AsyncWorker to address some issues raised, workshop for Node.js
    conferences this year, and general issues
  * OpenSSL evolution, doc capturing our plan landed.  Unfortunately looks like FIPs
    support will only come in OpenSSL 3.x (which is API but not ABI compatible) so
    we will likely have a gap between when 8.X goes EOL and there
    is a version of Node.js with OpenSSL 3.x
  * Core promise APIs - some discussions around support async iterators for transport
    streams (ex readable streams).  If people want to try to help its #27140 and Matteo
    is available to mentor.
  * Python 3 and Gyp, have updated with latest release gyp3, working to get python
    3 installed on rest of build machines. 
  * 2 new ones, startup performance the build resources.

## Q&A, Other

* No questions this week.
