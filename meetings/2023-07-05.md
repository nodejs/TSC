## Strategic Initiatives

* Performance Strategy Initiative: the PR to merge the caches was landed (Yagiz)
  * Vinicious’s PR on improving legacy CJS resolve just landed - <https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/73>
  * Yagiz spent some time on simdjson and replacing the package json reader in loaders - <https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/91>
* Next -10 - Michael - Recent survey results have landed - <https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/tree/main/surveys/2023-04>
* ShadowRealm: bootstrapping ESM and CJS module loaders in the ShadowRealm - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/48655>
* Darshan: Single Executable - working on PR to add support for byte code
  caching to improve startup time. Assumption was that it would be for all code, but that
  does not seem to be the safest thing to do. Waiting for some v8 changes to improve
  but for now making it so that is an option.  Also PR to add snapshot support, just added
  comments.
