## Minutes

### Utilize travel fund for all CTC / TSC members who want to come to Node Interactive [#147](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/147)

* Agreed to put out an announcement to @nodejs/collaborators for active collaborators who need financial help getting to NI NA. Michael Dawson agreed to put together a draft for this in the current thread.

### Consider folding TSC into CTC [#146](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/146)

* CTC discussed this last couple of weeks.
* Jeremiah is main strong objection to merging the two bodies.
* Bryan reported that one of Jeremiah’s objections is that we haven’t defined the problem first and have jumped to a solution, perhaps there’s other ways of dealing with the problem if we define it clearly.
* So what are the problems?
    1. Fundamental problem: CTC reports to TSC, will their interests always be in alignment? 
    2. Need concrete minimum qualifications for TSC membership.
    3. Difficulty in explaining technical governance structure to outsiders.

### Investigate moving `nvm` into the foundation [#96](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/96)

William: I feel it would be appropriate to have a discussion with the other version managers and ask them to be a part of the solution that is blessed by the Foundation.

Rod: What if all package managers want to be added to the Foundation?

Josh: If/when we accept nvm we should make it clear that it’s intended as a center of gravity for work on version and runtime managers and encourage others to collaborate through that repo.

It may be important to have a champion or leader for nvm/runtime managers to ensure minimum requirements like platform support are met. 

Rod: Compare to leadership for node-gyp, same could result for nvm.
