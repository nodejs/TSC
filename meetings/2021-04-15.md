## Agenda

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* doc: mark callback-based fs API as legacy [#37948](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37948)
  * had agreed discouraging use made sense, suggested updating docs.
  * the issue was commented stating "it's too early to mark them as legacy, a good alternative would be to update docs to discourage their use/explain the issue and how the promises based APIs solve them."

* dns: default to verbatim=true in dns.lookup() [#37931](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37931)
  * Change would have broken a lot of existing code where localhost is expected to be 127.0.0.1
  * Suggestion was to move forward with alternative where people could opt-in on a process
    basis. Would allow us to add as SemVer minor
  * In current state Ruben would recommend that we don’t land it.
  * Everybody seems ok with opt-in approach

* 2021-04-20, Version 16.0.0 (Current) [#37678](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37678)
  * Tagged for visibility

  * Please look at recent SemVer major additions
  * Working on some CITGM

* deps: add Yarn 1.22.5 [#37277](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37277)
  * [Draft for the vote](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1012#issuecomment-820688927)
  * Ongoing discussion in the issue
  * How long to keep on, target 1 week.
  * Half of the TSC members need to vote for the winning proposition.

* TLS: improve compliance with shutdown standard, remove hacks [#36111](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/36111)
  * Robert/Tobias are ok with it
  * Would be nice to have James input, but since not SemVer major should be able to land after
    CI is green, removing from agenda

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" or something similar [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * Thanks to Michael Zasso would rename 22 repos
  * Still making progress.
