### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Matteo: no updates this week, next one is planned for Feb 28, CFP for JSConf should go live
  before then. Early code to buy tickets before they go on sale for TSC members

* Joe:  no updates this week, discussion on travel fund, currently feeling ok in terms of requests

### nodejs/node

* Deadlock at process shutdown [#54918](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/54918)
  * Matteo, asked Platformatic person to take a look, current assessment is that it is a challenge
    as it’s not easy to unravel. Info seems to be that running a major garbage collector
    run before shutdown could fix the issue.
  * Joyee, the gc is supposed to already be doing something during shutdown, deadlock may
    be coming from that.
    * Can invoke gc from C++, currently used for testing.
    * We should validate that it fixes the problem locally before landing. Mostly seen in ci
      maybe we just run gc pass in the CI.
    * Remember a while back, pull request that indicated that we should not run task runners
      in the way that we do. Hunch is that it might be the way that we run the task runners.
  * Robert, we maybe should look at both, do quick and dirty to solve problem and then pursue
    better fix.
  * Matteo, solution on test runner, would register something that would run gc on exit.
  * Michael, since its an issue with the test running, sounds like the fix should be in the
    rest runner right?
  * Some discussion ensued with suggestion that a command line option that ran gc on shutdown
    and then adding that command line flag to problematic tests might be the way to go.
    We already have the mechanism to add command line flags in the test runner for a specific
    test.

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* Talk about how Node.js is funded - fund maintainers [#6626](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6626)
* Talk about how Node.js is funded - foundation and company support [#6625](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6625)
  * Michael: Claudio added the two above issues as an FYI. There is a discussion item on
    showing sponsors in the Node.js website repo
    https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/discussions/7477 which includes the mockup I'd already shared with the TSC
    This doc also covers what we have already reviewed, landed in terms of the projects funding approach:
