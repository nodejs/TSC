### nodejs/node

* stream: don't emit error after destroy() [#29197](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29197)
  * Matteo, significant change for behaviour in streams. When streams errors, still possible
    in some cases error may still be emitted again.  Discussion is around SemVer major change
    if Destroy is called a second time, error would not be emitted.
  * After destroy, the call with a second time with error.
  * Seems like we are at a stalemate at this point.
  * Gabriel: how useful to get error from second Destroy.  Seems like semantics of Destroy
    would be to release all resources, so getting an error on second Destroy seems like its just
    a JavaScript side effect, not something you.d expect.
  * Matteo, if it was me, if you do anything after Destroy, generate/return error saying already
    destroyed/closed.  Concern is that we have support the behaviour and potential breakage.
  * Jemeriah, if you call send time should we just though instead. Matteo fears that may be more
    breaking.
  * Matteo, lets explore the option of throw if you call after Destroyed/Closed
  * Next action: Jeremiah will write up his suggestion on Issue and we.ll go from there.

* buffer: add Buffer.harden() method [#28439](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28439)
  * Next action: please review and comment or approve.

* build: ongoing list of actions for Python 3 compatibility [#25789](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/25789)
  * covered under strategic initiatives discussion

* http2: make compat finished match http/1 [#24347](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/24347)
  * Original exception from Anatoli
  * Matteo: Some engagement but not too much
  * Matteo, Anna/Jeremiah can you take a look.
  * Matteo is fine with it.
  * Will wait for input from Anna/Jeremiah and if they think its ok and we don.t have any more
    input/engagement from Anatoli the objection will be over ridden based on our governance.
