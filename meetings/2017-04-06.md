### Updating the Copyright [174](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/174)

* Still waiting for board to respond to proposal for 2nd part, agreed
  In last meeting we should remove tsc-agenda until there is an
  update

### Clarify which people should be org owners [125](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/125)

* @joshgav: Would be helpful to document all GitHub groups and the
  repos and other resources they grant access to.

* This issue is primarily about whether TSC members should be org owners.

* What about Community Committee members?

* What permissions do GitHub org owners have?
  * Invite others to the org. We've been trying to solve this using the bot.
  * Create repositories, create teams.

* @Fishrock123: Could talk to GitHub about additional permission levels.

* @joshgav: Need to grant ownership to some subset so work is
  guaranteed to continue. If not TSC or CTC who?

* @mhdawson: Could be opt-in for those members.
* @nebrius: Greater access also increases risk from greater surface area.

* Next steps:
  * CTC issue to ask who should have access to security repo  
  * Open issue in CTC repo to poll use/need of org ownership

Michael to open the 2 issues.
