## Agenda

### Announcements

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* doc: move deprecated utils to runtime deprecation [#50488](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50488)
 - darshan: It’s not causing any maintenance burdens AFAIK, so it should be alright to keep around so that we don’t risk breaking any userland code
 - ask ronag to elaborate on the objection in the next sitting(ronag was not in at the time this was taken up)
* lib: hide `navigator` behind a flag [#50412](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50412)
 - antoine has an alternative PR opened that is expected more likely to get consensus
* test: set test-fs-watch as flaky [#50250](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50250)
 - tsc is aware.
 - gireesh: personally in favor of fixing CI flakes as issues become harder to reproduce and troubleshoot when those come from the field / production
 - antoine: flaky tests are a problem, maybe the TSC can brainstorm a solution
 - richard: a focussed effort is required to address the CI flakes
* deps,doc,lib,src,test: add experimental web storage [#50169](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50169)
 - richard: contention is on inclusion of sqlite. bring objections on the table for discussion and resolution
 - robert: the larger issue is whether a Storage API makes sense in core or not? how much complexity, how much memory footprint this will introduce, what implications to security, upgrade path, compile /link maintenance?
 - robert: we have seen a pattern of APIs with sub-optimal capabilities already, so this may not needs be an exception: not a super great idea, but no strong objection.
 - continue to wait for feedback from @nodejs/web-standards 
 - richard is going to make update in the PR
* Revert "doc: promote fetch/webstreams from experimental to stable" [#49867](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49867)
 - robert: already discussed in the last TSC. wait for a week to see what Kafra says, remove the label.
 - antoine: Let’s ask the author if they want a vote from the TSC. I think it’s only fair if they want to make up their case in a TSC meeting to convince us otherwise
* The env var `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` intermittently causes the process to hang [#49344](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49344)
 - no progress, nothing new, needs pending investigation. Defer.
* Support for file-system based persistent code cache in user-land module loaders [#47472](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47472)
 - did not discuss
### nodejs/TSC

* Changes to our nomination process [#1467](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1467)
 - continue to participate in the discussion: offline and in the next sitting.
* Automating Flaky Test Detection [#1458](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1458)
 - did not discuss
### nodejs/admin

* Have a mascot [#828](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/828)
 - did not discuss
* Create `nodejs/socket` repository for Node.js implementation of Cloudflare's Socket API [#826](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/826)
 - did not discuss
* Update meeting times [#1469](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1469)
 - call for action everyone: for updating the meeting times. even if your availability does not change, make an update so chair knows that it has been attended to.
