### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* FYI - changes to Foundation bylaws approved recently and published. See <https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/590> for some info about changes.

### nodejs/node

* Next 10 years of Node.js  [#34260](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/34260)
  * FYI - on agenda as FYI, first session today.

* Proposal: create a triage team to manage the backlog [#34054](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/34054)
  * Gireesh has action to submit PRs to add to governance to further discussion. We’ll remove
    the agenda tag for now
  * Myles, one place people related where it’s useful is finding ways for people to get involved.
    Was thinking in context of work we did in the past around code and learns, so in the same
    way this might be a good way to onboard collabs.

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" or something similar [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * holding pattern waiting for more guidance or tooling from Github.

* bootstrap: include bootstrapped Environment in builtin snapshot  [#32984](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32984)
  * Dan Bev is digging is, will wait until that completes before further discussion.

* Myles Would love to talk a little bit about npm v7 and the release strategy behind it if we have time. Haven't opened any issues about it yet (will soon)
  * Some breaking changes, trying to figure out which would be breaking for Node.js
    * one is update to help resolve peer dependencies, could argue that its breaking because it is
      “fixing”
    * exploring cutting npm 7 (off by default) or 8, to possibly land 7 with 14, 12 and 8 with 15.
    * revamp of run command, currently working
    * looking at cutting beta of 7 in master sooner than later in Node.js to get input on whether
      we can get it back into 12 and 14.

### nodejs/admin

* Audit Google account access [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/389)
  * Nothing new

## Strategic Initiatives

* Startup performance
  * Joyee: opened <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=10704>, rebased nodejs/node#32984 and made it work around that v8 issue while trying to fix it in the upstream. Would appreciate more reviews for that PR to land..
  * Danbev: I've started to review nodejs/node#32984 and will continue tomorrow. I also hope to have time to take a closer look at @addaleax suggestion but I only have tomorrow before a month of PTO.

* No update on build resources since last week.

* No major updates from modules

* Updates on V8 currency:
  - V8 8.4 landed on master. Release notes: <https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-84>
  - Backport PR to v14.x is open: <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34356>
  - WIP update to V8 8.5: <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34337>. The new cppgc is causing some issues with cross-compilation and Windows.

* QUIC initiative update: work is ongoing.
