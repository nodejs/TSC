* For now we'll switch over to hangouts for the next

### Bring string_decoder into the foundation [#272](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream/issues/272)
 
* There are no objections from the CTC.  Added comment to TSC issue 
  [#260}(https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/260) to say will 
  Be considered to be approved unless there are objections by Monday June 5.
 
### Request to move moderation responsibilities to CommComm[#270](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/270)
 
* Brian, was to support the potential re-org of the TSC
* James, there is an alternate PR for joint responsibility of moderation 
  TSC and community committee
* Myles, one thing that has worked well is the moderation repo.
  Transparency/openness is very important.  Need to make sure we
  Don't lose parts that are working well.
* Brian, do need to formalize escalation process.
* Rod, earlier discussions in comcom was to help set process/not own
  This is about moving responsibility.
* Brian yes.
* Rod, the people who get to make the decisions on the group should
  Be made by the group.  So in this case, potential issue because
  The comcom team does not come out of the technical team.  Really
  only concerned with github and technical team as opposed to other
  Channels.
* Myles, initial discussion was that it would be up to each of the
  teams/repos to accept moderation guidelines.
* Mikeal, moderation cannot really be delegated as it must be done
  by the group but the issue may be the escalation policy. 
* James, ideally the moderation policy would be consistent across
  The repos.  That's why suggested to have joint ownership and
  Escalation would be to both TSC and ComCom.
* Brian, a lot of merits to making it joint.
* Brian, specifically what the proposal would entail if it was to
  Move to comcom, docs would move to comcom repo, tweaks to TSC and
  Comcom charter.
* Mikeal, key thing is really where the escalation goes and currently
  that is only to TSC even though some of the repos are now
  Under comcom.  
* Brian, TSC has been slow to do the moderation work,people in comcom 
  may be more active in doing work. 
* Mikeal, we already have people that moderate across the repos. 
  De-escalation is the largest part of the work.
* James, proposal he put on table, moderators are from the
  collaborators from the project.
* Rodd, key thing is that doers have the influence over the things
  that impact them.
* Mikeal, 2 different things in the proposal to restructure TSC,
  representation and admin/groups. 
* Myles, one of the issues was community internally and externally.
  New role of the TSC, place for WGs to come together to share info
  and hold other groups accountable for their actions.
 
### How to progress the discussion on governance
 
* Rod, How to make it more digestable
* Mikeal, there are several issues and hard to discuss one at a time
* Rod, can we open up to a larger group for discussion.
* James, became complicated due to a larger number of comments from a
  smallish number of people.
* Myles, suggested a google doc versus a PR as living doc, that  
  anybody can modify and actions can be assigned.
* Mikeal, thread about representative structure.
* Myles, believe most people are ok, but smaller group don't like
  core having less say.  2nd point pushback from WGs that it would
  Generate more work/admin. Myles believes this is a way to bring
  more people in to contribute to decisions.
* and more discussion.
* open a new thread about how to move forward without getting into
  low level details.  Not tied to any proposal. Refining goals and
  current problems. 
* Tracy, suggest it might be good to find way to get neutral
  third party as moderator.
 
### Request: Additional 2017 Travel Fund Allocation [#250](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/250)
 
No objections so James to move forward.
