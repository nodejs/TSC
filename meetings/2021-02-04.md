* QUIC
  * was removed from the codebase, will be some news soon

* Build Resources
  * Nothing to report.

## Other

* We also has a discussion on the renaming of N-API to NODE-API. Seemed to be agreement that we can rename in the docs, surrounding/supporting stuff but stop short of changing the symbols, paths etc itself. Goal is that changes in the docs, surrounding/supporting stuff will mitigate the issue such that when people see N-API or napi it will be clear its NODE-API versus anything else.
