### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

\*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Revert the change of network interfaces family from String to Integer [#43014](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43014)
  * Richard: Is the whole change required to be reverted or can we just restore the family property of network interface objects to be a string?
  * Antoine: <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43054> make it accept IPv4 and IPv6 as inputs. The problem is on the getting, not the setting.
    The change is as minimal as it can be.
  * Matteo: we are lacking quorum, can’t approve it right now, moved to GitHub.
    At the end of the meeting we had quorum. We decided to revert.
* Auto closing old stale PRs [#42981](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42981)
  * Matteo: nothing to add, asked everybody to comment on GitHub.
* Make it possible to use Fetch with proxies or other agents [#42814](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42814)
  * Matteo: fixes landed on Undici, will issue a release today
  * Michaël to update it on nodejs/node.
  * Michaël: is this going to be the final answer?
  * Matteo possibly, but we will re-evaluate before graduating to stable.
* util: add parseArgs module [#42675](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/42675)
  only half the TSC has voted. We will wait for another week.
  Vote is in <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1225>
* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * Richard: unofficial-builds has been migrated. Hurray!
  * Michaël: new feature to protect the collaborators from pushing to branches (<https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-05-block-creation-of-branches-that-have-matching-names/> )
  * Richard: the features does not apply to org owners
  * Antoine: we need a volunteer to test this
  * Michaël: will do

### nodejs/TSC

* End-of-Life dates of Node.js 16 and OpenSSL 1.1.1 do not align [#1222](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1222)
  * Richard: we had pushback of moving the end of the LTS release
  * Richard is exploring if Red Hat would be willing to provide the support for the months that are missing (it is supported by RHEL 8)
    Wait another week before making the decision.
* 2022 TSC Chair election - Planning for May 1 ballot. [#1201](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1201)

## Strategic Initiatives

### V8 Currency

* V8 10.2 has been beta since Apr 28. Will be stable on May 24. Next Node.js 18 release is scheduled for May 31. <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule>
  * Micheal:  Support again Win32. Will be in the next release of Node 18. This will be a version of V8 that is LTS for ChromeOS. Previous version was v9.6. Should we lock this version of V8 in Node.js 18?
  * Richard: sounds like a good idea, but we are lacking information on what LTS V8 mean.
  * Matteo: I agree. How many V8 version will we be “behind” when Node.js 18 enters LTS?
  * Micheal: 5 versions (October). V8 releases every month now.
  * Matteo: how long V8 LTS is supported for?
  * Joyee: 10 months
  * Matteo: it does not cover for Node.js full LTS line. Good to lock to 10.2 for me.
  * Michael will open an issue to continue discussion
* Canary looks ok.

### Startup performance:

* Starting to include more into the embedded snapshot for workers (and maybe also vm contexts, need to investigate the compatibility of global proxies): [#42867](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/42867)
* Looked into [the memory corruption bug in user land snapshots](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=12718).
  * Merging embedded code cache into the embedded snapshot for safety (mkcodecache is going away): [#43023](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43023)
  * Workaround for the current repros in <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3616553>
  * Working on a more complete fix to guarantee consistent read-only space layout in V8.
