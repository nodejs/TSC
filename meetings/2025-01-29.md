### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No update this week.

### nodejs/TSC

* Plan for Collab Summit before/after JSConfUS [#1654](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1654)
  * No objections from the 8 TSC members at the meeting ?
  * 2 days, no ticket required for the collaborator, does not include conference itself
  * Matteo, can likely ensure that TSC members can always buy a ticket.
  * Not sure when the CFP opens

* Clarify the Charter so that contractors are explicity counted as affialiated [#1650](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1650)
  * approved and landed

* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
  * Robert - we have people opening PRs to mark tests as flaky
    * some PRs are being rejected with the suggestion that they should be fixed instead,
      no very productive
  * Matteo - we have a deadlock bug on exit - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/54918>,
    only happens on low resource situations with constrained resources. Affects all tests.
    That could lead to all tests being marked as flaky.
  * Robert have seen some cases where it really was flaky
    * Matteo, most objected to have been the 1 offs which are likely to the deadlock issue
    * Bug from person who is also doing most of the rejections (issue opened Sep 13)
  * Michael if we could extract just looking specifically at the shutdown issue we might be
    able to use some of the security bug bounty fund if TSC members would agree to that.
  * Matteo, will ping people he thinks might be good candidates to see if they can jump in
  * We will then discuss in next meeting.

## Strategic Initiatives

* Michael - Next-10, second ambassador onboarded.
