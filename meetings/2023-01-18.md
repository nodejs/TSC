## Agenda

### Announcements

* OpenJS Collaborator [OpenJS World / Linux Foundation Open Source Summit 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/), 10-12 May, Vancouver, Canada
* (ronag) Performance WG <https://github.com/nodejs/performance> - looks promising and good work!

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* OpenJS World as part of Open Source Summit
* Project Directed funding <https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/999>.
* CoC updates <https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/984>.

### nodejs/node

* Expose Undici's ProxyAgent and setGlobalDispatcher within Node [#43187](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43187)
  * ronag: This comes from the requirement of making fetch() proxy-aware. How can we achieve this proxying behavior? There are also other ways - support environment variables (<https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1650>)?
  * mcollina: Support for SOCK4/SOCK5 in Undici is missing atm but available in 3rd party modules.
  * antoine: Deno and Python support it. Java doesn’t.
  * tobias: Does undici use CONNECT for proxying?
  * ronag: yes
  * ronag: Should we just implement HTTP\_PROXY env var? That would make the problem go away.
  * matteo: Deno does it like that.
  * matteo: Wrangler (CloudFlare CLI) also supports it.
  * tobias: Is there any chance that implicitly proxying in undici based on the env var might break packages that explicitly proxy based on the same env var?
  * matteo: add HTTP\_PROXY and NO\_PROXY environs support in undici and discuss the semver-ness

* ronag: how urgent is <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/46234> ?
  * mcollina: revert and backport everywhere

### nodejs/llhttp

* Handle extra spaces in status line [#216](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/pull/216)
  * ronag: <https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/pull/216>
  * ronag: we have a maintenance issue with llhttp. Not a security issue atm.
  * mcollina: I agree with your worry
  * mcollina: Paolo Insogna has been maintain llhttp so far
  * mcollina: we can do all the changes in one big semver-major change or treat them as minors
  * mcollina: open a public issue to talk about it
  * joyee: llhttp is supposed to be easier to maintain than a pure c/c++ codebase
  * mcollina: the previous codebase is hard to maintain
  * joyee: is it about the dsl part?
  * mcollina: it’s well written. it’s more about lacking of documentation on internal library (<https://github.com/nodejs/llparse>).
  * joyee: is it still possible to reachout to Fedor to document the project?
  * mcollina: i can reach out to Fedor for documentation with a contributor guide. I will also open an issue on having a meeting about the new RFC.
