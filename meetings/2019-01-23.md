## Agenda

### Announcements
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* repl: emit uncaughtException [#20803](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20803)
  * Untagged from agenda.  For awareness needs TSC members to review to make progress.

### nodejs/TSC

* NODE_MODULE_VERSION for Electron Major Releases [#651](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/651)
  * Issue is with projects that bundle Node.js but use different versions of the
    dependencies (for example V8 or OpenSSL)
  * Gabriel - single number poses some issues as it means that more versions of the
    binaries.
  * Michael, in terms of unbreaking 651 would it make sense to allow new version to be
    grabbed and then figure out longer term approach.
  * Gabriel, making it easier to grab a number is good anyway so we can start with that.
  * Discussion in the meeting is that we just need a PR to bump the ABI number in master
    but Gabriel ‘volunteered’ to confirm process and comment in 651 on what specifically to
    do.
  * Gabriel will also create a new issue to continue discussion around whether we want
    to assign bits etc. (PoC is in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25539)

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
