   * Python 3 strategic initiative: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/25789

       * Longer term we may get rid of this dependency.
     * Goal is to be able to support both Python 2 and Python 3 by end of year
     * Some recommendations
       * we should look at using virtual envs, de-couples from OS version and gives us
          better control
       * Should adopt GYP3 fork
       * Need to update build machines to support both Python 2 and Python 3
    * Key issues
      * need to move to GYP3(or whatever it will be called). Rich: understanding is there is strong
        desire to make it happen
      * V8 has old python, need to speed flow of changes in. Help on this front would be great
      * build machines, need help from the build wg to do this
      * jenkins will also need build help to configure jobs etc.
