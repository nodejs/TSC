### nodejs/node

* buffer: runtime-deprecate Buffer ctor by default[#15346](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/15346)
  * we had discussed privately if we wanted to move forward now or now.
    General agreement was that we were going to move forward.  
    Rich: we should be getting the message out as quickly and as
    broadly as we can.   
  * Rich: asked if it was ok to post the votes ? 
  * Michael Z: put something in the warning with suggestions as to 
    what to do
  * Rich: good idea, try to craft some wording in the PR

### nodejs/TSC

* Node.js OpenSSL Strategy [#479](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/479)
  * Rod, outlined approach that is in the issue.
  * James, we should not not delay, don't want to have a pattern...
  * Rod, he passed the plan by the OpenSSL team and they agreed it made
    sense.  They seem to have committed to ensure ABI stability.
  * Myles, if they have committed to ABI stability, then we won.t
    necessarily have to wait.
  * Myles, risk of vulnerabilities ?  Rod, TLS process has been
    quite rigorous in reviewing the algs so risk should be small.
  * Rod, believe we are in a better as opposed to worse position.
  * Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings
  * proposal also agrees to include existing job that tests 1.02 
    dynamically linked.
  * Anna, question about supporting 2 versions, how is that going
    to work.
  * Rod, would like to stop, but distros are not going to stop so
    all we can do is educate people

* Foundation Update from Mark Hinkle
  * How can I help you?
    * Travel funding

  * modules, 2nd meeting today (26 people), notes are up. Team
    not chartered, but many stakeholders some core some other.  
    Question did come up as to what we should do for PRs that
    are landing in core.  Can team block? Don't have prior art on
    this. Team will open PR to discuss process so this is a heads
    up.

    Still working to get out of experimental in 10.0.0.
