## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* stream: move prefixed files into internal/streams. [#11957](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11957)
  * Added to agenda for awareness, please review and comment in issue.
  * Taking off agenda until there is a more specific question.

### nodejs/TSC

* doc: initial version of strategic initiatives [#399](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/399)
  * Myles, we should scope to specific initiatives, not general stuff
  * Rod, would like definition of strategic initiatives
  * Myles, running update at start, comparison to standup, part of reason they stopped
    making sense was due to numbers.
 * Myles, initially thought it would be something that puts the project at risk if not done
   if we don't align on it
 * Take back to github for now.  All on TSC please review/comment as to scope of what should
   be on the list.
 * Lets work on a stronger definition as well.

* Proposal to form a Governance Working Group [#383](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/383)
  * Doodle is open to setup first meeting, if interested please fill in your availability

### nodejs/admin

* meta: fix case of extensions on internal docs and move CoC to admin repo [#25](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/pull/25)
  * Main question is around moving the CoC out to the admin repo
  * Myles, moderation policies is in TSC, but CoC is in TSC repo
  * James had suggested we keep CoC in TSC repo, main pushback may be
    because we have just moved it.
  * Defer until we have a meeting with James and until then take discussion back to 
    github.
