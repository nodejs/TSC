### Announcements

* Node.js 25 scheduled to be release today!
  * Deprecation of SlowBuffer was pulled from 24, back in 25 tomorrow.
  * There are going to be people affected. Should have means to upgrade dep trees
  * Need to keep an eye out for other places that are impacted.
* Volunteers needed for Mac OS X infra, see [https://github.com/nodejs/tsc/issues/1793](https://github.com/nodejs/tsc/issues/1793) for details

### Reminders

* Remember to nominate people for the [contributor spotlight](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/reconizing-contributors.md#bi-monthly-contributor-spotlight)

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

* Approved 2026 budget, includes reduction in support for LFIT (Ryan) ... need volunteers to help fill the gap.
* No jsconf in 2026, quite possible to have an event in 2027.
* Currently revising parts of the in-kind contribution model. WIP.

### nodejs/admin

* Transfer DataDog/orchestrion-js to the org [#1011](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/1011)
  * There have been no objections, welcome to the project!

### nodejs/node

* src: change default config to package.json [#59842](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/59842)
  * Tabled until people in the call to discuss
* util: add colorize functionality [#43523](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43523)
  * Re-opened because of questions of recent supply chain attacks. We cannot take on everything that's potentially an issue here. Adding things to core won't solve the problem.
  * Might not be relevant due to styleText, other additions
  * We're not opposed to landing this stuff if it's useful, just not for the reasons of supply chain attack mitigation

### nodejs/build

* web-infra access to search console [#4127](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4127)
  * Approved in the latest TSC meeting

### nodejs/TSC

* Update charter with communication responsibilities [#1754](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1754)
  * Tabled for Nov 5 meeting
* Self-serve model for funding Node.js work [#1747](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1747)
  * Tabled for Nov 5 meeting
* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
  * We have funds currently.. expected to be more in 2026, we can viably do a RFP.
  * The biggest challenge is paying attention to the issues and pushing follow up.
  * Automation only gets us so far, we need someone to actually fix things
  * Next step: draft RFP focusing on burndown of existing flaky test backlog, get CI as green as possible. 2-3 months time period. Need SOW with $-cap.
