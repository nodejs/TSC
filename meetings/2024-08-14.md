### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

\*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No updates.

### nodejs/admin

* Conversion to Enterprise account [#905](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/905)
  * Matteo has converted “nodejs”

* module: unflag detect-module [#53619](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53619)
  * Behind a flag in 22.x and 20.x. The ask is to enable detection by default in Node.js 22.x.
  * Matteo: if we want feedback right away, we should release it now; if we want to be cautious, let's wait for 23.x
  * Antoine: do we expect it to be breaking?
  * Matteo: No
  * Ruy: IMO having feedback earlier is valuable in this case.
  * Joyee: I'm not opposed to releasing, I just wonder what's the strategy for dealing with the potential breakage.
  * Matteo: We're only 2 months away from 22.x being LTS, one could argue it's indeed too short.

* Antoine: IMO 2 months is long enough for getting feedback – and possibly revert if it turns out to be semver-major.

* Matteo: good to land it now, if we need to revert we can mark as semver-major.

* Joyee: we would need a CITGM run

* Richard: We had some issues with CITGM, with a npm regression, causing us to miss the other regression.

* Matteo: Any objections for releasing in 22.x? We are ok to release it in v22, but keep a close look on the CITGM results in case of a breakage. If that happens, we might want to consider labelling it as semver-major.

* _No objections_
