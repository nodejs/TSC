## Agenda

### Announcements

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Enable explicit `.m.js` intent for ESM [#16170](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/16170)
  * Bradley, that thread contains the thought that we don't need to import non-esm modules.
    There are a number so should likely be more generic to handle others like wasm,
    json etc. 2 older formats that should be included in the discussion as well.
  * Next action, Myles to schedule working session which includes this and other
    topics that we don't have consensus on.
* buffer: runtime-deprecate Buffer(num) by default [#15608](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/15608)
  * Question was: If and when Buffer constructor is deprecated, might Buffer(num) be deprecated
    before other forms of Buffer constructor? Or will they be deprecated all at once?
  * Take it back to GitHub for a week, need champion to better frame what the decision is we need
    now and why.
* timers: setInterval interval includes cb duration [#14815](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14815)
  * Tagged by Jeremiah
  * Current set interval has callback that takes a significant amount of time, next interval will
    be scheduled after the callback end.  PR changes to schedule so that it is based on
    when the previous one started.
  * Light discussion in the TSC meeting.  New behavior sounds right (needs to be
    semver major as it is already tagged), question about whether it should also be
    queuing if multiple intervals are missed but that can be handled in a follow on PR.
    Michael to add comments to PR.

### nodejs/TSC

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * quick update was provided by champions

* Register Node specific MIME types [#371](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/371)
  * Bradley - suggesting we make the controller the Foundation as opposed to the TSC.
  * James - should be ok if we tie to the TSC.  Does not need to be legal entity.
  * Bradley - they are asking for standards org.  That is what should be the Foundation
  * James - don't think it matters.
  * Bradley, leave TSC as change controller and standard org is identified as Foundation.
  * Rod - rather have the TSC as both.
  * We'll move forward with it as the TSC.

### Other

* Foundation Medium blog post on modules
  * we brought this up and no objections using the Foundation Medium blog
