* Shigeki Ohtsu: little time to work on node right now, joined the LTS meeting to discuss OpenSSL LTS
* Trevor Norris: reviewing issues and PRs, noticed a bug in asyncwrap
* Domenic Denicola: issues and PRs, v8 team has a new Project Manager who is more interested in node; communicated our API stability concerns to him
* Ben Noordhuis: fixed a big memory leak, fixed a regression in windows module loading, reviewing PRs, responding to bug reports

### Review of the previous meeting

* Travel assistance amendment (no issue for this)
* FYI: Collaboration WG: <https://github.com/nodejs/collaboration>
* Summit recap
* level-set on repo rename
* Future: “project lifecycle” (Mikeal) - process by which top level projects are added (libuv, node-gyp, etc), (conferences…)

### Procedure for rolling out node-accept-pull-request [#2434](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2434)

* Discussed some potential concerns, which were alleviated:
* Jeremiah: Wondered how to land PRs where nits needed to be fixed.
* Bert: Concerns about Jenkins costantly building the wrong PR in the io.js CI infrastructure.
* Trevor: asked for a dropdown to pick the reviewers.
* Bert: asked whether the job would support landing multiple commits. Alexis confirmed this.
* Alexis: mentioned that there is also an node-accept-commit job that is more low-level and advanced.

### Release procedure changes & nominating @sam-github and @jasnell as releasers [#2416](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2416)

No objections to combining the a whole "release team" to handle all release branches including 0.10, 0.12, stable and LTS.

### node-gyp is now in our org [#2379](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2379)

* Rod: node-gyp has a busy issue tracker and has no tests, needs more eyes
* Ben: Zero tests?
* Rod: Correct.
* Domenic: on Windows Chromium’s depot_tools will automatically download VS community edition and put it in the right place. Someone with copious free time could have node-gyp do similar things.

* Discussed maybe looking at `gn` (the eventual replacement for `gyp`)

* Domenic: even v8 still uses gyp, don’t worry about it for a good while until noise about it being deprecated gets louder
* Rod: issue [#151](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/151) in build has a discussion about precompiled native addons. Chime in!
