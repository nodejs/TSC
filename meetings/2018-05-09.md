## Agenda

### Announcements

### nodejs/node

* fs: drop duplicate API in promises mode [#20559](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20559)
  * FYI, no opposition should just move forward

* doc: add documentation on porting from Buffer(arg) usage [#19827](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19827)
  * Rich cannot make it, will update offline
* Tracking Issue for Runtime Deprecation of Buffer constructor [#19079](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19079)
  * Rich cannot make it, will update offline

### nodejs/TSC

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * skip since Myles could not make the meeting

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * N-API - versions now out for 6.X, 8.X, 10.X and master (8.x needs an update to be up to date with the rest)
  * New version of node-addon-api published
  * Focus is no adding doc for node-addon-api.

* http2
  * still making progress, trying to let it stabilize
  * may be updates to some of the error handling.
* Workers
  * slowly moving onward, waiting for a couple of PRs to land which lay the groundwork
    for both works and other aspects like embedding.
* Error Messages
  * Moving onward, nothing specific to report this week.
* Core Promise APIs
  * Making progress, limiting to fs for now to figure out pattern and how to expose, not creating
    others until it settles.
* New Streams APIs
  * Making some progress, getting pretty close to wanting to bring repo where the work is being
     done into Node.js org.
* V8 currency:
  * Last blocking issue for 6.7 upgrade being fixed upstream thanks to @mmarchini. It was again 
    a problem related to us supporting an old Clang version. Issue was opened suggesting we
    upgrade the Clang version required to build node: https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1264
* Async Hooks
  * Nearform team spent some time with google team pretty thoroughly and identified a number
    of performance bottlenecks.  Matteo will open a PR that improves performance but requires 
    an API change (was able to keep it from being breaking).
* Trace Events
  * Ali working on enabling trace events support in inspector protocol as a way to get
    at the trace events
  * James working on intrinsic to for fast trace events from JavaScript. It is a PR that
    updates V8 but is against our repo for now to experiment.

* Proposal: add all new core modules under a scope? (too late for http2) [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/389)
  * “module ids can change while the module is experimental” - do we agree on this?
  * Should we rename asap?
  * We have moved the promises API back to fs so not as critical, but still needs to be
    revisited.

## Q&A, Other

* No questions this week.
