See https://github.com/nodejs/bootstrap/tree/master/proposals

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)

  - Modules: Our understanding is that the module team is working forward on a minimum implementation
  - N-API: Lots of activity with [node-addon-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-addon-api). Working on porting important npm modules. Still in the process of marking tsnf as non-experimental.
  - Governance:
  - Streams: Jeremiah beginning to look at what a pull stream api would look like for libuv.
  - Async-Hooks: weakrefs & domain silliness
  - Open Standards:
  - Core Promise APIs: new PR opened by Matteo - generate a promise out of a ‘once’ eventemitter event: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26078.
  - Python & GYP: Made most core python scripts be compat with both python 2 & 3. Working on gyp core now. Trying to get both python 2 & 3 into the build/test matrix in CI.
