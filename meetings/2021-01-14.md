  * FYI as per process

* http: replace destroySoon with socket.end [#36205](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/36205)
  * Two opinions on how we should implement TCP RST packet in TLS
  * Needs very low level understanding of TCP
  * Matteo: What we currently have is likely not correct, but unclear on the correct answer
  * Anatoli not sure on right answer, related issue is that we don’t have a good set of tests
    in terms of spec compliance.
  * Chalker, would having those tests help with next steps?
  * Rich would having spec compliance tests help resolve the dis-agreement
  * Matteo -> Most realistic is to look at what others do, nginx, haproxy, copy that
  * Anatoli, makes sense as well
  * Rich will post comment that we want to know what nginx is doing to help decide which way
    go. Best way to decide is matrix of what others do nginx, apache, ha-proxy
  * Will remove from agenda for now

* TLS: improve compliance with shutdown standard, remove hacks [#36111](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/36111)
  * Rich -> Need James to talk about, as we need at least his lack of objection, defer to next week
  * Was opened by one of the libuv releasers, libuv has held off on some changes in libuv, has provided PRs to Node.js project which is this PR to help resolve. Changes  likely to go into next release.
  * Rich will follow up with James.
