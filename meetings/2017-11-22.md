## Agenda

### Announcements

* no announcements.

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Enable explicit `.m.js` intent for ESM [#16170](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/16170)
  * Rich: Myles is putting together a doc to communicate what has been firmly decided and what
    is still being discussed. We don't need to discuss today.

### nodejs/TSC

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)

  * Went through those for which champions were in attendance:

    * N-API
      * working on getting through issues raised by those who have used it so far
      * Push on documentation for node-addon-api
      * Putting together plan for moving out of experimental
    * Error Messages
      * Migration to error codes (Joyee): Currently, a lot of errors for wrong argument types are
        thrown from the C++ code. If we move the exception to JS, people using process.binding()
        will hit an assertion and crash instead of throw. Will create an issue to ask about this.
    * Moderation - no update
    * Onboarding - new collaborator this week and a number of events modeled on Code + Learn in
      Taiwan, Japan, Israel, India, France
    * V8 Currency - no update this week.
    * Register Node specific MIME types [#371](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/371)
      * Myles added to agenda
      * Added comment to issue to ask that more context as to what the question is for the TSC.
