## Participants

* Michal Dawson
* TJ Fontaine
* Colin Ihrig
* Julien Gilli
* Robert Kowalski
* James Snell

## Website

Robert: Partially redirected http -> https for api docs and docs. Only blog
page missing. Learning about SNI. Documentation generation tool: created a
tests suite that runs some smoke tests. Hopes to get a PR for that next week.

TJ: We have a wildcard cert for the blog, so using this cert might be easier
than using SNI.

## 0.11.16 release

Colin: has two bug fixes not API breaking that could go in for 0.11.16.

TJ: Would like to put https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/8966 in v0.10. Colin
hasn't tried to rebase it on v0.10, but will do today.

## Building dependencies

James: Working on refactoring the way dependencies (deps/) are built.

TJ: The build refactoring should target the master branch, and then might get
backported to v0.12.

## PRs/Issues in io.js

TJ: When we see bugs in io.js that are also in Node.js, then please report
these bugs.

James: I'm going to go through the recent changes in io.js and will report
issues/PRs.

## PowerPC support

Michael, James and TJ: Jenkins agents building and running tests for the Power
platform will be hooked up asap.
