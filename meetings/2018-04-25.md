## Agenda

### Announcements

* (fhinkel) Three open issues asking permission to move repos into the foundation. Everybody on TSC and CC, please do quick votes on GitHub. Mostly a formality because our policy requires it:
  * [#257](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/257)
  * [#492](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/492)
  * [#490](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/490)
* Jeremiah - created trial discord to see how that works for communication. Issue: https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/53, Discord link: https://discordapp.com/invite/eF23Jpc

* Michael - reminder about TSC Chair and Director nominations.

* Anna - announcing Node.js 10.x went out.

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* doc: add documentation on porting from Buffer(arg) usage [#19827](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19827)
* Tracking Issue for Runtime Deprecation of Buffer constructor [#19079](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19079)

### nodejs/TSC

* Coordination on npm releases  [#528](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/528)
* Wiki Management [#525](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/525)
* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * Board meeting coming up on Monday
  * Call for any issues to be brought to the board?
  * Now request from those on the call
* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * N-API - still working on 8.x backport and regular issue
  * Modules - in “yes and” and building list of modules, meeting later today
  * HTTP/2 - Myles if you have deep understanding, need help to get 8.x caught up. Volunteer
    to pair but needs somebody else to dedicate time.  Anna does not have much time in
    near future.
  * Workers - nothing new on that front, some work going on in general, but we have an issue
    blocking on windows, trying to get people to help.
  * Error messages - Working through moving the C++ errors over.
  * V8 currency - Nothing special to report
  * New Streams APIs - High on his plate to get to the point where we can get more people
    Involved

* WHATWG Participation Policy [#532](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/532)
  * Myles - open group, no meeting, all on GitHub.  Nothing stopping us from participating.
    You can just show up and participate. Bias towards serving browser vendors as that is
  part of their charter, we could try to change that.
  * If we want to be on the same page we might spin up an open standards strategic initiative
  * If you want to get involved don’t wait on the project, if you want to represent Node.js project
    would be good to coordinate internally.
  * Next step would be to see if people are interested in participating in a standards initiative.
  * Myles volunteered to see if there is interest in forming a group.
