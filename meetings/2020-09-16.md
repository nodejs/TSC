* doc: change requirements for objection dismissal [#35037](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35037)
  * Discussion around the bigger problem
  * On the specific issue
    * Matteo objects, but adding “unless the objector marks their objection as final”
    * Ruben, this addresses a common case where the objection is non-responsive at all
      after raising the initial objection.

  * Talked about fast track, TSC members more autonomously can remove objections
    * James will take a stab on alternative approach.

* util: add util.parseArgs() [#35015](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35015)

* doc: drop minimum waiting time as hard guideline [#33879](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33879)
  * James, proposal by Anna, following contribution survey
  * objections in thread that it makes is more difficult for people internationally
  * compromise proposal ->
      Reduce the current time limits to 24 hours with two sign offs, at least one of which is from
      relevant CODEOWNERS team, or 72 hours with one sign off.
  * however, objections have not weighed in.
  * Agreement was to open issue in TSC repo with proposed resolution (option 3 along audit of code owners), unless there are objections  in 1week we will go with that.  Michael has action to open that issue.
