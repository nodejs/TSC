### nodejs/node


* macOS Installer Requires Notarization To Be Run Under Catalina and Beyond [#29216](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29216)
  * Short on OSX experts, people with cycles
  * Need help/volunteers, if nobody steps up to help.
  * Michael: some discussion about only fixing for latest LTS releases.
    * any objections?
  * Matteo, does not affect nvm, so we maybe we can point to that.
    * only affects pkg
    * still good to fix
  * At this point we believe pkgs will stop working for Catalina in Jan and we
    don’t have a plan/volunteers to fix that.


### nodejs/admin


* Should we host a code and learn in Montreal [#432](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/432)
  * Don’t have a volunteer
  * Tobias -> challenges with CI currently as well that would make it a challenge
  * Gireesh -> we should look at topics and consider for later in the year.
  * Posted into issue: discussed in today's TSC meeting, no volunteers. Since we
    need to provide an answer unless there is a volunteer to run it by end of day
    today (Nov 6) we'll let the conference know they can get the time back.
    Matteo will let the conference org's know based on issue.

* Collaborator Summit - Montreal 2019 [#416](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/416)
  * reminder that collab summit is occurring and please submit sessions.
