### nodejs/node

* doc: change fetch from experimental to stable [#45684](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45684)

* Matteo: a few factors make it difficult to call undici fetch stable (<https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1737>), main issue are cookies. fetch/undici/cookies don’t play well together. More issues with blobs. Expect API changes, hopefully only additions.

* Michael: mention differences in documentation? Partially non-stable?

* Matteo: fine by me. Cannot read cookies right now because not allowed by spec. Discussed by WinterCG. Proposal on <https://github.com/wintercg/fetch/issues/6> and open PR in fetch spec repo: <https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1346>. Fetch is ready for general usage. Calling cookies stable requires more work.

* Michael: Can it be used to send authentication headers?

* Matteo: Yes.

* Antoine: Can we call fetch stable if Web Streams are still experimental?

* Matteo: Should stabilize both at the same time.

* Antoine: Are Web Streams ready to graduate to stable?

* Matteo: Should discuss in issue w\.r.t. connection to Web Streams. Matteo will leave a comment in the issue and leave this on the agenda.

* Michael: Web Streams in Node.js seem more stable than in some browsers.

* Expose Undici's ProxyAgent and setGlobalDispatcher within Node [#43187](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43187)

* Matteo: undici supports a way to implement proxy agents that https.request does not offer. Could set up a proxy just using undici. The issue is asking for more of undici to be available through Node.js, especially the ProxyAgent and the API to set those agents (<https://undici.nodejs.org/#/docs/api/ProxyAgent>). It doesn’t make sense to only expose these two and not the rest of the API. System was designed so that users can just install undici and it will work with native fetch. Question remains: do we want to expose more of undici?

* Michael: Is undici stable enough?

* Matteo: That’s a question for @ronag. Most of undici is stable. It has three million downloads per week.

* Darshan: How would it be exposed?

* Matteo: Maybe node:undici or http.undici. Would need to vendor it completely. It is not a problem of bundle size but of API surface. Matteo to write a recap in the issue. Would be good for TSC to chime in.

* Tobias: Is there any chance we’d ever use a non-undici implementation of fetch, in which case undici would be baggage?

* Matteo: Nobody knows! We’ll see. The current way works: npm install undici. We might want to document this though.
