### nodejs/TSC

* Invite TSC members in the Google Calendar event for meetings [#1133](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1133)
  * Beth - zoom link should be added to the invite

* vote: future of primordials [#1104](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1104)
  * Gireesh - vote open, should end this week, results will become available then

* Looking for feedback: Pointer compression in Node.js [#790](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/790)
  * Matteo - prototype exists, worth pursuing, great results in terms of memory consumption, official support would require much more work, need volunteer
  * Tobias - is 4 GB limit per process or per thread or per context or isolate?
  * Matteo - presumably per isolate, but need to check with V8 team
  * Robert - Is there a performance regression?
  * Matteo - based on tests a while ago, no. Might actually be faster due to better cache utilization. Needs more testing.

### nodejs/next-10

* Next 10 - Mini summit - Modern HTTP and Documentation [#108](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/108)
  * Closed nothing to discuss.
