* Michael: CPC discussions to be aware of
  * spinning up team to define scope and MVP for CoC at OpenJS level

    specific events.

### nodejs/node


* doc: add runkit embeds[#30241]( https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/30241)
  * Issues from last time:
    * executing JavaScript code from their domain in our region.
    * tracking our users
    * redirecting users
    * do we need to warn people that some content is coming from outside
    * can we make it optional to enable runkit.


  * Francisco, is our guest this week to give us an overview and answer questions.
    * Discussed within ComComm in the context of the website. Would be good to allow
      examples/code to be runnable in documentation
    * The PR is a sample adding runkit to crypto doc: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22831
    * One of key impetus is to get people involved earlier.  This would allow things to be tried out
      immediately with the nightly docs allowing you to run/test out new code without having to 
      download the docs.
    * not too much progress has been made on the website side of things
   
  * Gabriel, when you see embedded link you see embeded link and you see it run somewhere else.
    * Francisco, there are already playgrounds that you can link to
  
  * Answering questions in the last discussion:
    * what happens if there are outages (seems like it degrades nicely to just show the code)
      * Just defaults to as if was not runkit enabled in the first
    * executing JavaScript code from their domain in our region.
      * no dynamic code only that required for embeds, execution runs outside of browser
    * Privacy concerns
      * Runkit is complete trackerless
      * No user information is forwarded from browser to Runkit backend (will be there by the time PR lands)
      * Websocket is used to send code over from website and then back to the browser when you hit
        run.
      * Only connect to Runkit if you select run button
      * enabled through example by adding “runnable”  after ```js

  * Other users
    * npm already has this on their site (has button that says try on runkit)
    * ExpressJS and KoA already has fully integrated versions    
    * js: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
