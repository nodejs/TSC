### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Michael: Board meeting this week. Quick overview of requests to board.
* Michael: CPC discussions to be aware of
  * spinning up team to define scope and MVP for CoC at OpenJS level
  * Travel fund, seems to be moving towards agreeing to land/constitute travel fund at OpenJS
    level then in second PR amend to projects can request budget/make their own approvals for
    specific events.

### nodejs/node

* doc: add runkit embeds[#30241]( https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/30241)
  * Issues from last time:
    * executing JavaScript code from their domain in our region.
    * tracking our users
    * redirecting users
    * do we need to warn people that some content is coming from outside
    * can we make it optional to enable runkit.

  * Francisco, is our guest this week to give us an overview and answer questions.
    * Discussed within ComComm in the context of the website. Would be good to allow
      examples/code to be runnable in documentation
    * The PR is a sample adding runkit to crypto doc: <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22831>
    * One of key impetus is to get people involved earlier.  This would allow things to be tried out
      immediately with the nightly docs allowing you to run/test out new code without having to
      download the docs.
    * not too much progress has been made on the website side of things

  * Gabriel, when you see embedded link you see embeded link and you see it run somewhere else.
    * Francisco, there are already playgrounds that you can link to

  * Answering questions in the last discussion:
    * what happens if there are outages (seems like it degrades nicely to just show the code)
      * Just defaults to as if was not runkit enabled in the first
    * executing JavaScript code from their domain in our region.
      * no dynamic code only that required for embeds, execution runs outside of browser
    * Privacy concerns
      * Runkit is complete trackerless
      * No user information is forwarded from browser to Runkit backend (will be there by the time PR lands)
      * Websocket is used to send code over from website and then back to the browser when you hit
        run.
      * Only connect to Runkit if you select run button
      * enabled through example by adding “runnable”  after ```js

  * Other users
    * npm already has this on their site (has button that says try on runkit)
    * ExpressJS and KoA already has fully integrated versions
    * js: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match>
    * go: <https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/?m=all#example_FileServer>
    * lodash: <https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#drop>
    * rust: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/char/fn.from_u32.html>

* doc: add example for cipher.update() [#28373](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28373)
  * Defer to next time

* async-hooks: introduce async-storage API [#26540](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26540)
  * Being covered by  [#803](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/803)

### nodejs/TSC
