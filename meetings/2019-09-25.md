### Announcements

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates
 
* Board
  * Board meeting is this week. Nothing on board to be discussed with board at this time.

* CPC 
  * progress on CoC proprosal
  * working on project progression

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* deps: update V8 to 7.8 [#29493](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29493)
  * New pull request, which has 7.8 building. Only 1 more patch needed beyond where it was
  * Michael updated xcode requirement for 13.x
  * Myles, requesting to land SemVer major past cutoff. 
    * Bethany wording is that there need to be no objections to it landing after cutoff. 
    * Bethany will send out email asking for objections for SemVer majors, if none will include.
    * No objections voiced in meeting to this one landing.

* src,lib: make ^C print a JS stack trace [#29207](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29207)
  * Consensus from the 10 TSC members present is opt-in. That seems to align with previous
    feedback as well as feedback from the tooling team.  

* build: ongoing list of actions for Python 3 compatibility [#25789](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/25789)
  * [ ] tap2junit: v0.1.5 release (nodejs/tap2junit#12) to the Python Packaging Index    [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tap2junit)
    * repo moved to nodejs org, was blocking being able to run jenkins testing. PR
      to make python 3 compatible.
  * [ ] node-gyp: release so that npm can pick it up https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1791#issuecomment-533715634
    * working on doing round trip. Blocked by OSX bug. Christian is working on that.
  * [ ] re-vendor npm's gyp back into nodejs/node __/deps/npm/node_modules/node-gyp__
  * [ ] Travis CI does not test ./configure --ninja test #29415   __*** help needed ***__
    * Sam, some discussion about testing configure options, not all are tested.  Some tested
      in docker. Question is why this one?  Less vital if the tap2junit lands.
  * [ ] node-gyp: Accept Python 3 by default (_semver-major_) nodejs/node-gyp#1844 (macOS fails)
  * Sam: call-for-volunteers  -- the nodejs/node-gyp team could use more people involved, and that the  https://github.com/refack/GYP3 project does as well. https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1791 has more information. Without more engagement, this situation will slowly get worse.
### nodejs/TSC

* TSC representation on Moderation Team [#757](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/757)
  * Myles not concerned and no barrier to entry
  * No concerns from any of the TSC members.

## Strategic Initiatives

* Modules
  * Moving forward, hit tiny hiccup. Flag caused bootstrap with flag to be different than without
    flag. Removing flag caused changes and exposed some unexpected regressions
  * Needed to put proxies in place for built in modules so that they can stay in sync between
    CommonJS and ES6, but has performance cost. For most modules perf is ok, but for process
    and buffer, not likely acceptable.  Re-evaluating ways to approach this, in particular with
    performance critical APIs. Pre-req to remove flag
  * Gut feel is won’t be able to remove flag for 12.x LTS. hoping to land to get things perf
    consistent.

* N-API
  * Working on workshop for Node+JS interactive
  * Working on improving thread-safe functionality in node-addon-api

* V8 Currency
  * Talked about V8 earlier, nothing else to add

* Open Web Standards
  * Joyee: TPAC last week. Not a lot of Node.js related discussions. 
  * Want to move core test runner into it’s own package, then vendor in to tools so it can be
    published on npm.  WebCrypto project under Node.js org wants to use it.  Related to running
    the Web Platform Tests.

* Python3 
  * Covered above

* Startup Performance
  * Still working on upstream issues in V8 to unblock to be able to include loaders in snapshots.
