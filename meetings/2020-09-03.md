## Agenda

### Announcements

* Mary is taking over as CPC rep from Matteo, thanks for doing that!

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

* No updates from the CPC
 
* Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.


### nodejs/node


* \[v14.x backport\] stream: simpler and faster Readable async iterator  [#34887](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34887)
  * Please review/comment on the issue
  * Myles, see Matteo chiming that it is a good thing so comfortable that it will land, personally
    ok to move forward as long as CI is green.
 
* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" or something similar [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * has been switched for some repos
    * Myles, changed for CITGM, rather painless, no issues. Repo has less engagement so was
      expected to be easier. Next would be nodejsdev.  Still a few more github features we’d want
      before considering for main repo.
  * Ruben -> default changed for new repo creation.

* process: Change default --unhandled-rejections=throw [#33021](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33021)
  * Voting on the default behavior for Promise unhandled rejections [#916](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/916)
    * Main issue being discussed is whether is should be anonymous or not
    * Myles, any chance that if we propose a solution we’ll get consensus?
     * Mary, not sure we’ll get consensus, before the vote there were at least 2
       Objections
     * Myles would be good for Mary to make suggestion (having been most involved)
       to see if we have consensus
     * Mary will send suggestion to the mailing list
     * Myles will send Mary a list of different technologies that can be used.
  
### nodejs/nodejs.org

* blm: convert to button [#3306](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/3306)
  * Myles, not sure if it needs to remain on the agenda.
  * Mixed feedback 
  * No objections in the TSC  meeting, so it can land.

### nodejs/TSC

* Package manager manager ... discussion [#904](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/904)
  * agenda label has been removed.

### nodejs/admin

* Audit Google account access [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/389)
  * no progress

## Strategic Initiatives

* build - no update, 
* Modules - open discussion on Node.js/node on module export patterns, don’t have consensus
  if it should land - https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34718, would like to get feedback from
  TSC members.
* Future of build chain, repository created, issues starting to be populated.
* next ten years of Node.js - please take a look if you have a chance https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/pull/11/files
