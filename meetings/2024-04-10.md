### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* deps,lib,src: add experimental web storage [#52435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/52435)
  * We discussed and came to conclusion to proceed with the pull-request. We have no objections for it to land, other than existing collaborator comments.
* doc: add policy for “placeholder” executables [#52107](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/52107)
  * A vote has been started - https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1527
* deps: remove corepack [#51981](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51981)
  * A vote has been started - https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1527
* build: enable `yarn` and `pnpm` Corepack binaries by default [#51886](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51886)
  * Postponed until the vote above has been finished.

### nodejs/TSC

* Proposal to reduce inactive collaborator duration [#1524](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1524)
  * Yagiz opened a pull-request to decrease it to 6 months
  * Some people raised concerns and recommended 12 months as the duration for inactive collaborator detection.
  * Yagiz: Any person can execute arbitrary code in CI by just adding a “request-ci” label. This is a security concern.
  * Antoine: Triagers also can trigger CI runs on potentially dangerous PRs, and there’s no inactivity deadline for them.
  * Yagiz: Due to consensus, we reduced it to 12 months, and will take another action to remove it further in a month.
* Corepack decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)
  * A vote has been started - https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1527
  
### nodejs/admin
