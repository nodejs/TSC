## Strategic Initiatives

* Modules: Things continue to move forward.  Current discussion is when to remove the
  final warning (Making non-experimental). Discussing timeline (possibly around Node.js 14.x
  going LTS in October) but others believe we can do sooner.  Would still stay as experimental. 
    * Matteo, not convinced we should remove warning until it is stable.
    * Myles, believe it is pretty much production ready. Work is around improving warning and
      edge cases.
    * Matteo, have a number of specific cases that are not yet covered, will share list as 
      input to the experimental exit criteria
    * Myles do want to get to point were we remove warning before it exits Experimental so
      that we do get more adoption before doing that.
    * We remove warnings for Async Hooks, promised APIs, possibly N-API.  Don’t think
      we have any governance that requires warning for Experimental
    * Next step is to document criteria to be met before removing the warning. Already at the
      point were there are no plans for major changes.

* Core promise APIs, still moving forward, some areas like http where not sure yet what we
  should do.

* V8 Currency
  * Matheus working on update to 8.1. Will be pushed today should be ready for
    Node.js 14.x. Version 8.2 branch has been created. We might be able to get it
    * Myles what are the update plans.  8.1 for 13.x
      * Michael Z not likely as 8.1 is quite breaking and we never updated 8.0 in master.
    * Myles, for 12 are we able to update any more?
      * Michael Z. Anna believed it would have been difficult to update to later version. 
        Currently no plan to update V8 anymore in 12.x
      * There are some pref issues with the version of V8 in 12.x (note fixed in later versions0
        Cloning is an example. Michael Z believes there is a backport that might help address that.
     * Myles if we can get some benchmarks that show issues and then try to get
       V8 team to get involved.
     * Next step is to open issue in V8 issue.
