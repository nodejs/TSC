## Agenda

### Announcements

* CFP for OpenJS World has been extended
* OpenJS World registration has also opened.

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Board meeting this week.
* Michael: Microsoft identified a 2 people who between them will have ~ 1day/week to contribute 
  on the build side.  Had initial touch base and am getting them connection to build WG like
  recent new Google person. 

### nodejs/node

* Recent behavior change of buffered write callbacks [#31317](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/31317)
  * We made a change to always make callbacks on the stream side occur where they did not
    occur before
  * There is an objection to the PR which landed.  The doc specifically says when
    they are called
  * If there were a bunch of write calls in parallel, what happened if the stream was
    destroyed by the other side, then the callbacks would never be called. Not even
    with an error.  The PR that landed made them be called with an error.
  * Gabriel, for a stream, an error should be presented at least for the stream.
  * Gabriel, before user of API could use existing error notification, but would be
    harder for callbacks.
  * Sam, who does it break?  Seems like good idea to eventually call callbacks
  * Michael: also what does it break?
  * Matteo, prefer current functionality but case for revision is that it is significantly
    different but harder to monkey patch.  
  * Sam tools like pipe and pipeline still work ok? 
  * Matteo yes because they are relying on the error handler.
  * There have been some side effects and bugs being opened.
  * Gabriel would be good to have Luigi on a call.
  * Michael he can’t make it next week either.
  * Matteo anybody who has gone through think its a good idea to revert?
  * Matteo, my opinion is that callback should be always called.
  * Gabriel, possible that if one write fails stream is still useful?  
  * Michael, which releases is this in -> 13.x
  * Rich open to try to find how to find backwards compatible support, but 
    reluctant to revert
  * James also reluctant to revert, new behavior is better.
  * Sam, to clarify. Before one write would always get an error, but never more than
    One? Matteo yes.
  * Sam, there is a general problem in the streams. There are 3 flows of events. The causal
    relationship between them is not well defined.  It’s better if its well defined that if you 
    gave a callback it will be called.
  * Please engage in the PR, 
  * Matteo, any objections to saying we’d prefer the current behaviour
    * No objections.

### nodejs/TSC

* Node.js future directions - any interest in online or in person summit? [#797](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/797)
