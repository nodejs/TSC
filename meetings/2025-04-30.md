### nodejs/TSC

* Let's talk about the CI situation [#1614](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1614)
Gireesh: hard to organize the bounty, distribute money, workload etc…
Paolo: are we blocked on foundation?
Gireesh: Could use some help from new contributors.
Darshan: how do we let contributors know this is a priority
Marco: we could add it to our technical priorities

* NodeJS Feature Bounty Program [#1723](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1723)
Darshan: someone asked for a feature on loaders, hard to find who to get in touch with from the project. We could create a list of contributors in getting funding in a specific area. Does not go through Openjs
Paolo: do we list people who are interested in work in a specific area and the specifics are discussed in private (money/time etc…) between the two parts? Looks reasonable
Darshan: not perfect and the legal part is hard across multiple countries, we could improve it.
Paolo: maybe the foundation could give legal help?
Need to make clear that the feature is not guaranteed to land

* Adopt Datadog Test Optimization tool [#1721](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1721)
