## Agenda

### Announcements

* No announcements this week.

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Board meeting this week, let me know if there is anything you think I should be raising, nothing
  that I am aware of.

### nodejs/node

* doc: update CI requirements for landing pull requests [#37308](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37308)
  * Quick discussion is that can go through the regular review, already has
    TSC approvals
  * Documents what has been regular practice
  * Adds requirement for green github CI.
  * No objections TSC members in the meeting, removed agenda tag as
    seems to be progressing through the regular review process ok.

* deps: add Yarn 1.22.5 [#37277](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37277)
  * Michael added his blocking objection as believe there should be an explicit decision by the
    TSC. Has been lots of discussion.
  * Myles, there has been other discussions like package manager manager, should include in
    vote, some of concerns as well.
* Include Yarn, Include PMM, Leave as is for now
  * Before we vote, invite author to argue in favor of the requests
  * Myles, should we do a survey to gather more information that will help TSC members decide
    how they would vote.
  * Michael, any volunteers do do the survey
  * Consensus seems to be to try to do survey before vote, next step is to find volunteer to drive
    survey..

* fs: remove permissive rmdir recursive [#37216](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37216)
  * added to agenda as SemVer major for TSC visibility.
  * Michael Z, not opposed but alternative API is not available in 12.x. If author wanted to
    support across LTS versions they would need a version check.

* http: align with stream.Writable [#36816](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/36816)
  * On the agenda to get TSC attention, leave on agenda until next time to see if
    that input occurs.
