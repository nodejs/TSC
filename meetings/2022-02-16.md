## Agenda

### Announcements

* The Node.js trademarks have been donated by Joyent/Samsung to the OpenJS Foundation <https://openjsf.org/blog/2022/02/14/node-js-trademarks-transferred-to-openjs-foundation/>
* OpenJS World CFP extended to 25th of February
* New collaborator!

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* crypto: clarify `require("crypto").getRandomValues` is Node.js specific [#41782](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41782)
  * Matteo: What is the problem? The question is unclear
  * Antoine: James Snell added getRandomValue() as an alias to the require(‘crypto’) module. Tobias noted than there are might be webcompatibility. The compability issue is that getRandomValue() required this to be an instance of the spec Crypto object.
  * It seems there are no conflict on the PR, just waiting for more approvals.
  * Check out [#41779](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41779), this includes the deprecation of getRandomValues(). Added the tsc-agenda label and we will talk about it next week.

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * Richard Lau: there are a lot of scripts that could break.
  * Michael: it should not be possible to use git-node-land and land things to the wrong branch.

### nodejs/TSC

* Invite TSC members in the Google Calendar event for meetings [#1133](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1133)
  * Matteo: this is mostly done as everybody has received their invites. Removing the tsc-agenda label

* vote: future of primordials [#1104](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1104)
  * Antoine: the vote has closed and the vote has been pasted in the PR. We can close the PR.
  * Matteo: the PR needs to be finalized and landed. Antoine will do it.
  * Antoine: do we want to do another vote? I’m currently busy right now.
  * Matteo: If there are no other volunteers I propose we wait for another vote until the error path is finished.
  * Michael: what does the vote mean?
  * Antoine: the vote means that a PR that improves the tamper proofness of the error path can be blocked/reverted only if it causes a performance regression (or if there are other concerns regarding code quality unrelated to primordials)

* Looking for feedback: Pointer compression in Node.js [#790](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/790)
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/790#issuecomment-1041404279> explains that we have a 4GB limit per process.
  * Tobias: there are valid use for large memory usage
  * Michael: what is the default memory limit for Node.js?
  * Michael: buffers are not affected by pointer compression.
  * Matteo: We agree we need a champion for this to progress it further.

### nodejs/admin

* Bot user for nodejs/corepack [#660](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/660)
  * Matteo to open an issue on nodejs/corepack to make dynamic downloads of the package manager version.
  * +1 for having a bot to keep corepack updated in Node.js - maybe we can just update the eslint one to pull the new release. Antoine to do it.

* blocklist import/export [#659](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/659)
  * On agenda for awareness.
