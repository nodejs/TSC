  * N-api: [#19262](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19262) PR take n-api out of experimental, no objections  üéâ, waiting to pass CI
  * Async Hooks:
    * Coming in 10.0:
      * Deprecation of legacy versions of node::MakeCallback
      * Both NAN and NAPI now have support for context propagation using the async hooks embedder API
      * If any native module authors would like assistance with handling these changes, they can contact @ofrobots, or look at examples: of native modules already migrated to propagate context correctly fsevents, bcrypt, node-sass
  * V8 currency: 
    * Master is on V8 6.5. Mostly performance improvements. Includes mitigations for spectre and meltdown vulnerabilities. Opened PR to disable those at build time by default: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19222
    * PR wip for V8 6.6 update. This will probably be the version that we ship in Node 10.
    * Will open an issue to discuss whether we want to prepare a forward ABI/API compatibility patch for V8 6.7 or even V8 6.8 to make it easier to upgrade during Node 10's lifecycle.
