### Node.js "Users" feedback [#66](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/66)

Michael Dawson: how do we make sure we are getting input from a wider range of users?

Rod: I maintain that our governance model is the best we have so far at controlling the direction of Node, if you want to have a say in that direction, the easiest way is to commit resources to core and surrounding development.

Mikeal: The user base is so large that just having representation likely will not cover everything well.

Mikeal: We can actually quantify the data from some of our surveys quite well, last one hit about 12,000 people.

Rod: We need to make sure we don’t have buying into the foundation level giving technical control though.
