### nodejs/TSC

* Package manager manager ... discussion [#904](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/904)
  * Mael:
    * working on Yarn since 2017
    * one issue is `people use npm because it’s the default`
    * one issue is that people don’t get to choose, it’s the projects which make the decision
    * each package manager has slightly different behaviour so you have to use the one
        that is used for the project.
    * The question is not which is best, but how to best let the co-exist.
    * He’s going to take us through the package-manager-manager flow, shared screen
  * Chalker - https://github.com/tribou/words/blob/master/package.json#L7-L11 (random repo from gh search)
    * is why I think that this should be a separate field because versions can
      already be specified and are already specified and this change adds a pm
      restriction, while version range restriction is already there

### nodejs/admin

* Audit Google account access [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/389)
  * still waiting on this to happen.
