## Agenda

### Announcements

* No announcements this week

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Make recursive rmdir more strict [#35250](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35250)
  * Benjamin, provided some history
  * main discussion now is around error checking, after discussion suggestion is for the
    following:
    1. Let's mark the current API as stable, since it's used a lot
    2. Rename the current API to e.g., `rm` while keeping the current API as alias
        to the new one
    3. The alias gets deprecated
    4. Add a new function that has the stricter version

* punycode: runtime deprecation [#35092](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35092)
  * Suggestion that it seems to be too disruptive, should go through --pending-deprecation
  * Discussed, there is concrete suggestion, going to remove tab.

* Myles, PR open for npm RC. Hoping to have it ship in 15.x.
  * Looking to see if the are any concerns/objections
  * npm 7 does have some breaking changes, change to alg for peer dependencies
  * target is to cut 13 Oct to move out of release candidate.  Gives 1 week before 15.x going out
  * Rich, support provided that Release WG is supporting it
  * Michael, what will the expected impact ? Myles, at this point no CITGM modules are affected,
    there is easy work around by adding command line flags or env variables.

* 2020-10-20, Version 15.0.0 (Current) [#35014](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35014)
  * PR to revert PR that is causing deprecation warnings with npm

* doc: drop minimum waiting time as hard guideline
  [#33879](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33879)
  * Mary will post recommendation to the issue, and close. (from last minutes)

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" or something similar [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * Github has started releasing more of the tools that help convert
  * Next step is to convert one of the repos with more integration/eyes like nodejs.org, nodejs.dev
    * Myles will look at that next week

* fs: simplify copy operations and more cleanups [#31038](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/31038)
  * implicit breaking change that was not intentional
  * it’s something that works, but normally we would not allow it to
  * Most of the time our APIs would not check for prototype properties
  * Next step Ruben will PR in guidance for creating “APIs” to document what we think should
    apply to all APIs and that will inform what we do in this case.

### nodejs/admin

* Audit Google account access [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/389)
