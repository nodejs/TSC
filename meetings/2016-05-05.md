## Minutes


### OS X buildbots/ci: call to action [#367](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/367)

* Rod discussed the unsustainable situation we are at with Voxer and how we need to find a new donor or ask the Foundation for money.
* Mikeal: Yahoo! Might have some resources that we could use. Rod should reach out to Dav Glass or Brian English.

### Define "Node.js core" [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/84)

* Mikeal: last person in the nvm thread made a good comment about the TSC’s role being to set standards, the whole area of how to install Node is a mess because package managers don’t update quick enough.
* Alexis: what is the purpose of the definition of Node core? Is it to define the responsibility of the TSC?
* Mikeal: to help define what the level of support is that we want to offer.
* Rod: basically comes down to the scope of the TSC’s autonomy.
* Rod proposed a definition that includes “those components that are required to build, maintain and ship a basic Node.js development and production environment to users” … approximately.
* Discussion around this type of definition.
* Bryan: extend it to include “being able to install components from the ecosystem” (would include npm and NAN and node-gyp)

### Rod Vagg: can we make these meetings once every two weeks?


*  Group agreed


### Roll-up reporting

* Rod to propose on GitHub that we ask for regular roll-up reporting for active working groups, ask what they are working on and planning on working on.
