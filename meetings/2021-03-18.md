### nodejs/node

* There are a number of open PRs in the nodejs/node repo that are waiting for approvals from TSC members to land: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22review+wanted%22++label%3Asemver-major. Since the v16 semver cutoff is getting close, I think it would be worth mentioning it in the meeting.
