### CPC and Board Meeting Updates
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.


### nodejs/node

* quic: part 3... initial quic implementation [#32379](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32379)
* quic: part 2... ngtcp2 and nghttp3 [#32378](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32378)
* quic: part 1... quic-modified openssl [#32377](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32377)
  * Rich - these are an FYI, not time critical, let's discuss concerns raised when James is in the
    call ?
  * Myles: time critical part is whether it makes it into 14.x.
  * Rich: this can go into a later 14.x version since it is Minor so possibly not time sensitive.
  * Sam at least the patch is not too intrusive, but APIs continue to change. Split up patch
    helps make it reviewable.
  * Matteo's only concern is on the OpenSSL side, the rest looks fine.  Questions is what 
    happens if it breaks.    
  * Myles, could we have patch in tree and apply as part of build as opposed to being in.
  * Sam, dynamic apply might be more complicated, could just have rule that if applies
    clean then ok, otherwise drop patch
  * Myles, still concerned over risk due to adding floated patch as that could impact 
    Binaries shipped.
  * Dan, from RH in the short term you will have to statically link Node.js if you need
    QUIC before it comes to OpenSSL.  
  * Chalker could we use the option to link against OpenSSL dynamically? Might
    allow us to decouple changes in core that way.
  * James by default no changes are built if you don’t have the flag enabled. 0 impact
    to the release builds. Patch that is floated has compile time guards for every change. 
  * For 1.1.1.f there was no changes, for 1.1.1.e some changes to guarded patch
  * Myles if guards confirm byte to byte specific, no longer concern assuming we
    just drop patch if does not apply.
  * James offered to go through anybody who would like one on one to go through patch.

### nodejs/TSC

* Review meeting date times ? [#809](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/809)
  * Agreed to move forward with last 4 time slot proposal
  * Michael to update calendar.
  * Make sure to separate the 14, 15, and 20,21 groups

* Node.js future directions - any interest in online or in person summit? [#797](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/797)
  * Matteo, from collaborator summit meeting. Assumption is likely to be remote, maybe
    We can leverage some of that work.

## Strategic Initiatives
