### nodejs/TSC

* Moderation Team annual certification [#1390](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1390)
  * Done

* Adding the OpenJS Foundation staff as a billing manager for nodejs-private [#1376](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1376)
  * Rafael: we can disable the Mac and Windows
  * Matteo: I’ve disabled the Mac and Windows workflow in nodejs-private
  * Moshe: we can trigger the Mac Workflow only when a specific label is present
  * Richard: we might disable macOS altogether from GitHub Actions because it’s very costly even for GitHub.
  * Richard: depending on how much activity there is in the private repo, we might still run out of minutes.
  * Matteo: take the action of getting a billing manager from the Foundation and add a small budget to it (100$/month) and see how it plays out.

* Opportunity: Grace Hopper Open Source Day (virtual) Sept 22, 2023 [#1372](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1372)
  * Rafael is planning to create the private curated list likely next week.

* CLI tools behind a Nodejs namespace [#1178](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1178)
  * Matteo: what is the question for the TSC? Was it there for visibility?
  * Moshe: maybe discuss the migration plan?
  * Matteo: push it to the next meeting
