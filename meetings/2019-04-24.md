## Agenda

### Announcements
 
*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node-gyp

*  v3.8.1 proposal [#1718](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/1718)
  * Issue is already closed.  Vuln in node-tar, fixed in version 4.X but node-gyp was not
    using that.  Update for node-gyp was semver-major.  Node-gyp version 4.x is now released
    so immediate issue was addressed. If people want a fix in node-gyp version 3.x it would
    need a change in node-tar first, discussion is ongoing: https://github.com/npm/node-tar/issues/212#issuecomment-486331373
  * Was not an exploitable issue for node-gyp itself. 
  * Issue was only open for 12 days, so no real problem in terms of timing either.
  * @chalker mentions that the vulnerability in node-tar did not effect node-gyp’s use of tar
  * https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/1718#issuecomment-485610857 is relevant

### nodejs/node

* Piping w/ spawn is broken in Node 11 [#27097](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/27097)
  * Anna came up with fix: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27373/.
  * agenda tag removed.

  * There has been some discussion around changing the name of the conference.  Two options
    being discussed.  
    * Some feedback from TSC members that name suggestions don’t communicate the reason
      for the conference so we need to be careful in what we choose.
  * Planning for blog post that outlines process once ready to send out CFP.
