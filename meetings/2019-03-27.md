## Agenda

### Announcements

* Node.js 12 is coming (end of April)! If you have breaking changes that you
  want to land, they will require TSC approval.
  https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/417
* Collaborator Summit will be at the end of May in Berlin (right before JSConf
  EU). There is a an issue for the Call for Sessions.
  https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/149
* Proposal for updating supported platforms etc. for Node.js 12.
  https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26714
    * gcc 6
    * Almost no feedback on macOS support proposal. Build minimum is 10.13 and
      XCode 10 with minimum support run on 10.11. (Rich says that seems
      reasonable.)
    * Python 2/3: We will have to support both out of the gate, but we don't
      want to be locked into supporting Python 2 for 18 months or whatever after
      it goes EOL.
* Currently 30 open pull requests labeled semver-major. Attention, TSC folks!

* New ESM implementation proposed! https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26745
 
### nodejs/admin

* Checklist to address changes due to move to OpenJS Foundation [#311](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/311)
  * One thing to get consensus on is how to select voting representatives on
    CPC. Gireesh has an alternative to treat TSC and CommComm less disjointed
    and more of a unified voice. Discussion to continue in issue tracker.

### nodejs/TSC

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)

  * V8 Currency: 7.4 is about to land on master which is the version that should
    be in Node.js 12.
  * Python 3 and GYP: A lot of work done to make GYP compatible with Python 3.
    There’s a PR being worked on. https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26620
  * N-API: thread-safe function backports have landed in v8.x.
  * Streams: No significant movement since last time.
