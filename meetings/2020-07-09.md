### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Proposal: create a triage team to manage the backlog [#34054](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/34054)
  * From collab summit discussion, suggestion of triage team
    * have been trying out in the Express repo with good success
    * people can request to become a triager, that then lets them help tag, help manage
      issues.
    * it provides another way that people can help without being collaborator
    * Rich, does this require write access?
    * Gireesh, no uses the triage role which has more limited access (tag, open/close issues)
    * Individual efforts are hard to sustain
    * If TSC agrees, next step would be to provide space for team collaboration (slack channel,
      get togethers, etc.)
    * No objections, or concerns a few Sounds good
    * Michael next step is PR to add role to governance/docs.

* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" or something similar [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * Discussed last week.  Waiting for tooling/pattern from Github or elsewhere before moving
    forward.

* bootstrap: include bootstrapped Environment in builtin snapshot  [#32984](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32984)
  * Has been discussed a few times, but we’re not helping to resolve
  * Dan possible to have one approach for internal/Node.js use and then a different one
    for user code.
  * Anna, think that is what Joyee is advocating.
  * Dan will try to take some time next week to take a closer look.

### nodejs/admin

* Audit Google account access [#389](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/389)

## Strategic Initiatives

* build resources
  * one past significant contributor is finding more time, yay!
  * Meeting planned with Linux IT to answer questions about potential scope we had
    shared/other questions.
