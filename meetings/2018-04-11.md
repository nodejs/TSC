### nodejs/TSC

* Tracking issue for updating TSC on Board Meetings [#476](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/476)
  * no board update this week.

* Strategic Initiatives - Tracking Issue [#423](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/423)
  * N-API - backports in progress for 8.x and 6.x.  6.x to start out as experimental.

  * V8 currency - V8 6.6 landed today on master. Waiting for a patch from the V8 team to make it compatible with upcoming V8 6.7. 
  * OpenSSL - Has not had time to update doc on current status yet.
    * 1.1.0 now in master, and in latest 10.X test release
    * Does not have 1.0.2 compatibility but we can add that later if people complain and
        people show up to do the work
    * Current plan, go out only with 1.1.0
    * ASM support is awkward due to new toolchain reqs, particularly on windows to
    * get assembly but at compile time. Proposed to have flag in vcbuild and configure, 
    * If you don’t have right tools you need to opt in so you don’t just get no assembly
       version without knowing about it.
    * Since bundlers don’t ship new versions, less important for the 1.0.2 support.

## Q&A, Other

* No questions this week
