## Minutes

### Next Collaboration Summit [summit#39](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/39)

@joshgav: Relationship to Code-and-Learn? Best to keep them well-separated since target audience is significantly different.

Are non-collaborators invited? Yes.

**Next steps**

* Continue discussion in GH.

### 1 Code of Conduct for everything? [community-committee#7](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/7)

@jasnell to open repo with PR for shared code of conduct. Are there any objections?

@williamkapke: some external links point there so need to ensure these are redirected.

@williamkapke: is a separate repo really needed? Should we put it in the TSC repo? Consensus is yes, would be better to maintain in TSC repo.

@jasnell to open a PR to put code of conduct in TSC repo, and to replace in other repos with a stub.

Propose to keep stub for a year, then remove.

@williamkapke: propose a canonical link off of nodejs.org which redirects wherever it goes.

@mikeal: canonical URLs which redirect to GitHub might help with other items too, like redirecting to board meeting minutes.

@williamkapke: document is copied in many repos, would be best to have one source of truth.

**Next steps**

* @jasnell to open PR to move code of conduct to TSC repo and replace in other repos with stubs.

### charter: revised membership rules [TSC#142](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/142)

Outstanding issues:

* Should we require a 2/3 vote for removal?
* How to best encourage participation through policy?

@mikeal: if there are objections we should reduce the attendance/participation requirements so board can review and approve now.

Proposed rules:
* Regular attendance at meetings (25%) over 3 months
* **or** participated in issues within past 3 months
* **or** voted in past 3 months.

@jasnell: What is the definition of the latter two? Propose complete inactivity for 3 months. @mikeal: Abstaining should count as participation.

After 3 months ask to participate more or resign. After 6 months removed.

@mikeal: Board will have interest in TSC membership process.

Current charter requires 2/3 to add, 2/3 to remove. Suggestion to reduce to majority for adding to make it easier, while keeping 2/3 for removal.

@bnoordhuis: would prefer to make everything the same as a simple majority.

Any objections?

@jasnell: Have not had to exercise this, donâ€™t anticipate issues.

Conclusion: Go with simple majority/>50% for everything to minimize friction. Ask for resignations after 3 months of complete inactivity instead of 6.

**Next steps**

* @jasnell to update PR and request feedback from TSC.
* @mikeal to consider for presentation at next board meeting.
