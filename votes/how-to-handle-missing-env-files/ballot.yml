# Based on the result of this vote, we can unblock either https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53177,
# https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53060, or neither if the status quo prevails. The name of the
# proposed flags are non-binding, and are provided only as examples. If a proposal that includes a
# new flag is accepted, the name of that flag can be bike-shed per the PR review process.
# "Ignore" means "do not throw and do not warn" in this context.
