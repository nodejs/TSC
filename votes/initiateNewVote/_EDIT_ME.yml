# To initiate a new vote, you need to open a PR modifying this file. The vote
# can start once the PR has approvals and is merged via the GitHub interface.

# 1. Select a subject for the vote. This can be a question addressed to the TSC
#    voting members.
subject: Reduce in-active collaborator duration

# 2. You can leave the header instructions as is, or modify them if you see fit.
headerInstructions: |
  Please set a score to each proposal according to your preferences.
  You should set the highest score to your favorite option.
  Negative scores are allowed, only the order matters.
  You can tie two or more proposals if you have no preference.
  To abstain, keep all the propositions tied.

# 3. Give a list of "candidates". Those should be answers to the subject
#    question, and should leave as little room to interpretation as possible. Do
#    not list candidates that don't have a champion, there should be a
#    clear plan for each candidates in the event where it wins the vote; listing
#    a "troll candidate" will only hurt the credibility of the voting process if
#    it wins and everyone realize we have to re-take the vote because it can't
#    happen. Don't hesitate to list very similar candidates, with however small
#    nuances: we are using the Condorcet method to count the votes, which lets
#    voters express their preference for each candidates, no matter how many
#    there are.
candidates:
  - Status Quo: Keep the current in-active collaborator duration of 12 months
  - Reduce the in-active collaborator duration to 9 months

# 4. Pass the following to false if it's important to keep the candidates in the
#    order you define above. Presenting candidates in a fixed order tends to
#    give an unfair advantage to the first option.
canShuffleCandidates: true

# 5. Insert here a short description of the vote objectives and link to the
#    issue it was discussed on to give the full context.
