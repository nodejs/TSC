# Onboarding/Offboarding

Please refer to the
[Establishment of the TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md#section-4-establishment-of-the-tsc)
in the TSC Charter. In the event that there is a contradiction between that
document and this document, the contradictory elements in this document are
invalid and are superseded by the TSC Charter.

## Onboarding

* Confirm that the new member has read, understands, and agrees to uphold the
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Add the new member to the `@nodejs/tsc` and `@nodejs/security-tsc` teams.
* Change the new member's role in the GitHub `nodejs` organization to `Owner`.
* Add them to the `@nodejs-private` org and with an `Owner` role.
* Add them to the `@nodejs-private/security-tsc` team.
* Add them to the `tsc` and `crypto-export` mailing lists.
* Update the `@nodejs/node` repository README to reflect membership in the TSC.
* Update https://github.com/nodejs/create-node-meeting-artifacts/blob/master/templates/invited_tsc and https://github.com/nodejs/create-node-meeting-artifacts/blob/master/templates/observers_tsc to reflect membership in the TSC.

## Offboarding

* Remove the member from the `@nodejs/tsc` and `@nodejs/security-tsc` teams.
* Change the member's role in the GitHub `nodejs` organization to `Member`
  unless they have `Owner` role for a reason other than TSC membership.
* Remove them from the `@nodejs-private/security-tsc` team.
* Remove them from the `@nodejs-private` org unless they are members for a
  reason other than TSC membership.
* Remove them from the `tsc` and `crypto-export` mailing lists.
* Update the `@nodejs/node` repository README to reflect membership in the TSC.
  In all likelihood, they should be listed as TSC Emeritus.
* Update https://github.com/nodejs/create-node-meeting-artifacts/blob/master/templates/invited_tsc to reflect membership in the TSC.
