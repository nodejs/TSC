## Introduction & History

NodeConf was started in 2011 by Mikeal Rogers (@mikeal) and Chris Williams (@voodootikigod).

Today there are several NodeConf's all run by differnet organizers who loosely support each other in the `nodeconf` GitHub org.

## Scope

All current and future NodeConf's:

* NodeConf US (currently in hiatus)
* NodeConf Adventure
* NodeConf EU
* NodeConf London
* NodeConf Barcelona
* NodeConf Christchurch
* NodeConf Santa Cruz
* NodeConf Buenos Aires
* NodeConf Austin
* NodeConf Oakland
* NodeConf Oslo

Conferences that aren't *called* NodeConf can also be admitted if they choose to be.

## Governance

Individual NodeConf's are considered Working Groups under the Foundation's Governance model.

The NodeConf Community is independently governed by existing conference organizers. The TC (Technical Committee) will use the
consensus seeking process that has become the standard in Node.js Core for some time.

A single seat on the TC is appointed by each Conference WG that has succesfully run their conference.

Because conferences can be significant financial liabilities full autonomy over decision making and finances is granted to
Working Groups without restrictions on their governance structure. If the TC believes that a Working Group is no longer representing
the values of the community its only recourse is to revoke the Working Group.

## Contribution Process

Anyone interested in running a NodeConf can create an issue on the `organizers` repo (currently called the `collective` repo).
If no objections are raised by the TC a new team and repo will be created that is owned by the requesting organizers.

If a conference is not run by its Working Group for more than one year it is considered to be on hiatus and new organizers can ask to
take on the working group.
