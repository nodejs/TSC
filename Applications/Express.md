## Express

The express project is applying to become an incubating
[Top Level Project of the Node.js Foundation][].

### About Express, User base, Community and Ecosystem

Express is one of the most popular web server frameworks available for Node.js.
For many Node.js developers, express is their primary interface with Node.js
on the server.

Express has consistently been among the top packages installed via npm, with
nearly 4.5 million downloads in December 2015.

It is important to recognize that Express is not the only web framework in the
Node.js ecosystem and that by incubating Express, neither the Node.js
Foundation or Node.js core would be "picking a winner" or endorsing Express
over any other overlapping or similar project.

### Scope

The express project is composed of a collection of separate modules and
documentation currently spread out over multiple GitHub organizations. This top
level project would consist initially of the following GitHub Organizations and
repositories within:

* jshttp
* expressjs
* pillarjs

The existing strongloop/express repository will move into one of these three
organizations.

In addition, StrongLoop will contribute the basic express API documentation
included in the strongloop/expressjs.com to the strongloop/express repository.

Many repositories in these organizations may be moved out or removed entirely
during incubation at the discretion of the Express TC. Prior to graduating
from incubation a full list of repositories will need to be provided to the TSC.

The Express TC shall decide on the complete listing of projects to be included
in this top level project as well as in which GitHub organizations those will be
managed.

### Formation of an Express TC

The current GitHub organization owners for each of the pillarjs, expressjs,
and jshttp GitHub organizations will be invited to form the TC of the Express
Top Level project. It is not expected that every existing owner will wish to
participate. Two months after the initial invitation, any owner that is not
actively participating would be automatically removed from the TC.

Ownership permissions in the pillarjs, expressjs, and jshttp GitHub
organizations shall include all members of the Express TC as well as the
mentors nominated by the Node.js TSC.

Collaborators currently having permissions to any of the repositories in the
pillarjs, expressjs and jshttp GitHub organizations will continue to have those
permissions. From the StrongLoop GitHub organization, users Rand McKinney
(@crandmck), Hage Yaapa (@hacksparrow), Mike Tunnicliffe (@tunniclm), and Sian
January (@sjanuary) will continue to have Collaborator permissions to
strongloop/express (in whichever GitHub organization it ends up).

Onboarding of new Collaborators would follow a process decided by the Express
TC but it is expected to be similar, if not identical, to the process used by
Node.js core.

The Express TC's purpose is the support, maintenance and further development of
the Express top level project under the Node.js Foundation.

The TC's responsibilities include:

* Management of the full set of GitHub repositories listed above
* Technical direction of the overall Express project
* Express Project governance and process
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators
* Overall release management

### Contribution and Governance Process

The contribution and governance policies would be bootstrapped using the basic
document templates provided by the Node.js TSC, and fine tuned / customized by
the Express TC once formed. It is expected that the contribution policy would
be very similar to that used by Node.js core.

The Node.js Code of Conduct, Moderation Policy and TSC Escalation policies
would apply.

The Node.js TSC will select one or more mentors to assist the Express TC in
it's formation and throughout the Top Level Project incubation process.

### Intellectual Property and Other Assets

Currently there are no IP assets included.
