## Establishing a new Working Group

A Working Group is established by first defining a charter that can be
ratified by the TC. A charter is a *statement of purpose*, a
*list of responsibilities* and a *list of initial membership*.

A working group needs 3 initial members. These should be individuals
already undertaking the work described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. Once established, these
responsibilities are no longer governed by the TC and therefore should
not be broad or subjective. The only recourse the TC has over the working
group is to revoke the entire charter and take on the work previously
done by the working group themselves.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently
undertaken by another WG then the charter will additionally have to be
ratified by that WG.

You can submit the WG charter for ratification by sending
a Pull Request that adds the charter to the WORKING_GROUPS.md document,
which adds it to the list of current Working Groups. The WG is considered
to be chartered once that PR lands. Once ratified the list of members should be
maintained in the Working Group's README.

### Base Policies for new Working Groups

Once the TC ratifies a charter, the WG inherits the policies established by the
TC for governance, contribution, conduct and an MIT LICENSE. WGs are free to
change these documents through their own governance process but should retain
at least the spirit of the original versions. The template documents provided
in this directory are provided to help bootstrap that process:

* [Charter Template][]
* [Governance Template][]
* [Code of Conduct Template][]
* [Moderation Policy Template][]

[Charter Template]: Charter.md
[Governance Template]: Governance.md
