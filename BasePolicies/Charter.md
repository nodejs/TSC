## Working Group Charter Template

Every Working Group requires a charter that describes the scope of
the WGs responsibilities. Once written, a new Pull Request that adds
the charter to the [TSC][] WORKING_GROUPS.md document must be opened. The WG
is considered to be officially chartered once the PR adding the proposed
charter is landed and merged into the relevant WORKING_GROUPS.md document

### Template: *[insert WG name]* Working Group

The Node.js *[insert WG name]* Working Group is jointly governed by the members
of that Working Group (WG).

The WG responsibilities include:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project [README.md][].
