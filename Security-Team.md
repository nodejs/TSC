# Node.js Security Team

Node.js security team members are expected to keep all information that they have
privileged access to by being on the team completely private to the team. This
includes agreeing to not notify anyone outside the team of issues that have not
yet been disclosed publicly, including the existence of issues, expectations of
upcoming releases, and patching of any issues other than in the process of their
work as a member of the security team.

## Node.js Security Team Membership Policy

The Node.js Security Team has access to security-sensitive issues and patches
that aren't appropriate for public availability.

The policy for inclusion is as follows:

1. All members of @nodejs/TSC have access to private security reports and
   private patches.
2. Members of the [release team](https://github.com/nodejs/node#release-team)
   have access to private security patches in order to produce releases.
3. On a case-by-case basis, individuals outside the Technical Steering
   Committee are invited by the TSC to have access to private security reports
   or private patches so that their expertise can be applied to an issue or
   patch. This access may be temporary or permanent, as decided by the TSC.

Membership on the security teams can be requested via an issue in the TSC repo.

## Team responsible for Triaging security reports

Initial triage is done by HackerOne staff. Once enough information is gathered
to confirm there is a reproducible issue, triage is assigned to this group.

The responsibility of Triage is to determine whether Node.js must take any
action to mitigate the issue, and if so, to ensure that the action is taken.

Mitigation may take many forms, for example, a Node.js security release that
includes a fix, documentation, an informational CVE or blog post.
