# Node.js Open Collective

The project maintains an Open Collective that is used to accept donations.

The funds are to be used for specific efforts as decided by the TSC and
documented on this page.

## Account details

The account is manged by the TSC. The user id and password
are shared with TSC members through 1password.

## Disbursements - management

Potential disbursements will be agreed through TSC discussion
and before approval, documented in an PR in the
[TSC repository](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) which adds
the intended use and funding envelope to this page. The disbursement
is considered approved if there's no objections from a project member
in 72 hours, and at least one approval from a TSC voting member.
Objections can be overridden with a TSC vote.

Once work has been completed the recipient will open
a request through open collective in the amout approved.

The Chair of the Technical Steering committee will then
"push the required buttons" in the Open collective account
to initiate the payout in accordance with the agreement reached in the
TSC PR and if possible include a reference to the PR
in the TSC repository adding the intended use and funding
envelope to this page.
