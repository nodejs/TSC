# The Node.js Foundation TSC

This is the primary communication and governance hub of the Node.js
Foundation's Technical Steering Committee. Its goals are:

* Maintaining, releasing and improving a healthy Node.js Core project.
* Fostering and encouraging a healthy Node.js open source ecosystem.

# TSC

The TSC has many working groups and projects. Each group and project
has a connection to the development of Node.js Core but their work and
responsibilities often extend far beyond Core and potentially even Node.js.

The TSC also leads several efforts to improve the health and sustainability
of the ecosystem but it is not a long term host of ecosystem projects which are
not integrated into Core development.

Each project and working group is autonomous. The scope of work and 
autonomy is described in their charter. The TSC works to increase communication 
and collaboration between all these parts.

Adding a new project or working group can be done through a pull request. Since
each group is autonomous any new group taking on responsibility from another
group would need that group's approval.

Any project or working group can create teams at their discretion. Any org member
can create a new repo for organizing this kind of effort without a charter or other
process. Examples of Core teams are: Long Term Support, Cryto, Roadmap, Benchmark,
Streams, Testing.
