## Mentors

Project mentorship is not a technical role. In fact, mentors are discouraged from giving technical advice to projects. Instead, the purpose of mentorship is to encourage and improve a projects ability to be participatory, transparent, and effective. Mentors are there to help projects adopt and iterate on policies and processes that achieve these goals and eventually allow them to graduate the incubation phase.
