# The Node.js Foundation TSC

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. It admits and oversees all top-level Projects in the Node.js Foundation. It also elects a representative to the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

For more details read the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md) adopted by the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors on June 17th 2015.

If your project is interested in joining the Node.js Foundation please read the [Project Lifecycle.md](./Project-Lifecycle.md) documentation.

## TSC Members

## Top-Level WG and TLPs

* Working Groups
 * Mentors
* Top-Level Projects
 * Core TLP
  * Core WGs (streams, http, Intl)

## Mentors

Project mentorship is not a technical role. In fact, mentors are discouraged from giving technical advice to projects. Instead, the purpose of mentorship is to encourage and improve a projects ability to be participatory, transparent, and effective. Mentors are there to help projects adopt and iterate on policies and processes that achieve these goals and eventually allow them to graduate the incubation phase.

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The Node.js TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under the Node.js Foundation. The TSC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top
Level Projects. Top Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should
be opened in the `nodejs/TSC` repository. 

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The Node.js Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.
