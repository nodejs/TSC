# In the Context of Node

This document attempts to layout the general structure of Node's success in order that the TSC may ensure decisions are made within the context of Node.

_This document is intended to be a living one. This document will expand, perhaps even change, into the future, near or far._


## Preface

Stories help us relate. The give us insight into the impact of various situations in the context of people. This is a collection of stories about Node, about the Node Ecosystem, about things that have brought Node to where it is, about the growth of the community and the individuals involved, and even those that continue on through today and into the future.

Node Core would be almost nowhere without these. Technology is nothing without an impact on people. However, since we are also people, ensuring that impact is positive is utmost important.

Given that these form the basis of what drives Node forward, caring and giving thought with these as context is a must when making large decisions about Node and the Ecosystem.


## The Stories of Node

### Node for Beginners

We all had to start somewhere.

For many, a start is gotten though web development and JavaScript. As a JavaScript platform, Node is an easy backend for this multitude of web developers to get started with.

* Uses the most popular and accessible programming language in the world, JavaScript.
* [NodeSchool Chapters](http://nodeschool.io/chapters.html)

### Node as a Modular Ecosystem

Node is driven forward heavily by it's vast ecosystem, much of which is in the form of modules contained within the npm package registry.

Two things of note have been at the forefront of driving a module ecosystem: Node Core's focus on staying minimal, and npm's ease of access for publishing and installing modules; both driven by an Underlying Unix Philosophy.

### Node as a Community of Developers


* [NodeConf](https://github.com/nodeconf)
* [Global Map of Node Meetups](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/events/)

### Node as HTTP servers & clients

Huge business interest for API servers

* The `request` HTTP client has 12,640,076 downloads in the last month as of Febuary 4, 2016.
* The `express` HTTP framework has had 4,746,758 downloads in the last month as of Febuary 2, 2016.
* 3 other major HTTP frameworks build ontop of express: Kraken.js, Sails.js, LoopBack.

### Node on Hardware

* node-serialport
* NodeBots

### Node as a Base for Front-End Tooling

* Preprocess toolchains
* Browserify
* grunt, gulp, Webpack
* Babel.js

### Node as a backing for Desktop Applications

* nw.js
* electron; Atom, VS Code, other editors built with it.

### Node with Open Governance

* Transparent, Effective, Participatory.
