It is important that members of our leadership groups (TSC, CommComm) act
in a way that not only complies with the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
but that supports the vision, mission and operating principles of the Node.js project.

Members are encouraged to have individual opinions and are encouraged
to express those opinions during discussions within the organization. While
discourse is encouraged internally, members also have the obligation outside
of the organization (for example in social media) to be respectful of the
decisions made within the projects's documented processes.  A member who does
not support a team decision or current team value may express the member's
opposition within the team in an appropriate manner, but must be extremely
careful when expressing the opinion externally.  External communication must
not be done with the intent of undermining a decision, project values, or
actions of the team. If another team member expresses that they believe external
communications appear to have the intent to undermine the committee
it is the responsibility of the individual expressing their opinions to rectify
the situation immediately. If a member feels that there is no recourse aside
from going public regarding an extremely contentious issue then they should
resign from the team before doing so.

In addition to being willing to act as a team player, members of our
leadership groups must conduct themselves in a professional and
respectful manner. Some general
guidelines include:

- Serve as ambassadors of the vision, mission and operating
  principles of the Node.js project.
- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. Leaders are human,
  and they will make mistakes - however they should act swiftly to
  acknowledge mistakes and correct them. Most often this can mitigate
  any damage done.
- Aim to remediate first and then discuss.  If other members of the
  team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by
  stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team
  to come to a common agreement.
- Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest
  standards of ethical conduct.  
- Valuing a diversity of views and opinions. Strive to avoid preferential
  treatment, and hold everyone (including ourselves) accountable to the same
  set of standards.  Everyone gets to speak up. 
- Deal with issues directly with the person in question. Resist complaining
  about others in the project in a public sphere.
- Built trust by keeping your promises.
- Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of
  ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals, discussing any concerns in person
  whenever possible, and taking responsibility for our statements by
  speaking as much as possible
  in the first person (.I. statements) rather than in the third person.
- Collectively and as an individual serve as a role model to demonstrate
  the highest standards of ethical conduct.
  
Finally, the public behavior of members reflects on the Node.js project.  It is
often difficult for those external to the project to separate actions which 
reflect the members private views from how they will act within
the project.  Members are expected to avoid acting in a way that might bring
disrepute to the Node.js organization and avoid any actions that might be
interpreted as undermining the core values of the project.
