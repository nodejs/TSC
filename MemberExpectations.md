It is important that members of our leadership groups (TSC, CommComm) act
in a way that not only complies with the code of conduct but that supports
the vision, mission and operating principles of the Node.js project.

While members have the right and responsibility to exercise independent
judgment and to express dissenting opinions during discussions within
the organization, members also have the obligation outside the
organization (twitter, reddit, etc.) to respect and support decisions
and values of the majority, even when a member dissented from
the majority view. A member who does not support a team decision
or current team value may express the member's opposition within
the team in an appropriate manner, but must not take actions publicly
that have the purpose or result of undermining the decisions, values
or actions of the team. Accordingly, a member who itends to publicly
oppose a team decision action should resign from the team before doing so.

In addition to being willing to act as a team player, members of our
leadership groups must conduct themselves in a professional and
respectful manner. Some general
guidelines include:

- Serve as ambassadors of the vision, mission and operating
  principles of the Node.js project.
- Treat all community members as professionals. with respect, consideration,
  and valuing a diversity of views and opinions. Strive to avoid preferential
  treatment, and hold everyone (including ourselves) accountable to the same
  set of standards.  Everyone gets to speak up. 
- Deal with issues directly with the person in question. Resist complaining
  about others in the project in a public sphere.
- Keep your promises. Your word is your bond. Commit to anything you can
  deliver upon. 
- Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of
  ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals, discussing any concerns in person
  whenever possible, and  taking responsibility for our statements by
  speaking as much as possible
  in the first person (.I. statements) rather than in the third person.
- Collectively and as an individual serve as a role model to demonstrate
  the highest standards of ethical conduct.
- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. Leaders are human,
  and they will make mistakes - however they should act swiftly to
  acknowlege mistakes and correct them. Most often this can mitigate
  any damage done.
- Aim to remediate first and then discuss.  If other members of the
  team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by
  stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team
  to come to a common agreement.
  
Finally, the public behaviour of members reflects on the Node.js project.  It is
often difficult for those external to the project to separate actions which 
reflect the members private views from how they will act within
the project.  Members are expected to avoid acting in a way that might bring
disrepute to the Node.js organization and avoid any actions that might be
interpreted as undermining the core values of the project.
