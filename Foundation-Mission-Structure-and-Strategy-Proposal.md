# Node.js Foundation Mission, Structure and Strategy

_Proposal to the Node.js Foundation TSC and Board, by Rod Vagg_

We formed the Node.js Foundation with clear short-term goals for Node.js but neglected to find broad agreement and buy-in of any mission beyond that

**Goal #1:** Agree on a basic statement of mission for the Foundation, upon which all execution, by each group within the Foundation, can be tested and justified

**Goal #2:** Agree on a strategy-generation and strategy-execution structure, and the relationship between the main bodies within that structure, that we can use to best achieve the mission of the Foundation

## Foundation Mission Statement

**The Node.js Foundation exists to increase the adoption of Node.js and increase participation in the Node.js project.**

This goal is achieved by:

1. Maintaining the health of the core Node.js project
2. Fostering and encouraging a healthy Node.js open source ecosystem
3. Fostering and encouraging a healthy commercial ecosystem of training, products and services for Node.js

_This is an executable form of the Node.js Foundation Purpose as presented in its by-laws, Section 1.4_

### Fundamendals

The proposed mission statement stands on a fundamental reason for existing: _“to increase the adoption of Node.js and increase participation in the Node.js project”_

Execution of this mission is divided into three prioritized areas: 
* Node.js core
* Open source ecosystem
* Commercial ecosystem

Node.js core remains the primary focus for the Node.js Foundation, all else builds on this

## Foundation Structure

The Node.js Foundation is made up of three distinct arms:

* The ***Board***
* The ***Executive***
* The ***Technical Team***

### The Board

* Ultimate responsibility for the activities of the Foundation and the expenditure of its funds
* Representation of financial donors (member companies), the Technical Team via a seat for a TSC nominee and the Node.js user community via elected Individual Member board seats
* Maintain focus on the fundamental goal of the Foundation: _“increase the adoption of Node.js and increase participation in the Node.js project”_
* Delegates all technical execution to the Technical Team, requiring approval of strategy that expands scope beyond Node.js core related concerns
* Delegates all business execution to the Executive, requiring approval of strategy and budget
* Delegates a shared responsibility for the Node.js open source ecosystem to the Technical Team and Executive, requiring approval of strategy

### The Technical Team

* Answerable to the Board via a Technical Steering Committee (TSC), a peak body that takes on an administrative role within the Technical Team
* Managed by an _Open Governance_ process, independent of the Board, that empowers individuals and companies investing materially in the technical development of the project
* Independently manages execution strategy for _“maintaining the health of the core Node.js project"_
* Shares responsibility with the Executive for proposing and managing execution strategy for _“fostering and encouraging a healthy Node.js open source ecosystem”_, requiring Board approval for any such strategy
* Serves as the container within which all technical execution of the Foundation’s activities takes place
* Covered by Section 5.4.b of the Foundation by-laws. Although Section 4.3.e of the by-laws mentions the possibility of additional _“top level projects”_ directly under the Board, the Foundation ***will use a single Technical Team as its top-level project*** for execution of all technical strategy.

### The Executive

* Responsible for the expenditure of Foundation funds in accordance with the broad wishes of the Board and budgetary approval
* Assisted by the Linux Foundation, using shared resources in order to maximise availability and minimise cost
* Manages paid staff of the Foundation, including, but not limited to, the Community Manager, Education Coordinator and part-time PR resource
* Serves as a resource for the Technical Team as required, including for the use of Foundation funds for technical purposes
* Responsible for proposing managing execution strategy for _“fostering and encouraging a healthy commercial ecosystem of training, products and services for Node.js”_ requiring Board approval for any such strategy
* Shares responsibility with the Technical Team for proposing and managing execution strategy for _“fostering and encouraging a healthy Node.js open source ecosystem”_ and requires Board approval for any such strategy

## Next Steps

1. Reach agreement on a basic statement of mission, upon which all strategy can be tested and justified
2. Agree on a strategy-generation and strategy-execution structure, and the relationship between the main bodies within that structure, that can best achieve the mission of the Foundation
