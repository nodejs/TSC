For a proposal to create or change a process foundation-wide, a PR should be
opened in the `nodejs/TSC` repository. 

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The Node.js Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.
